What is power abuse in the academic system? Is it a something new, or why it is gaining more and more attention?

In our newest survey (report is here: [https://www.helmholtz.de/fileadmin/user\_upload/06\_jobs\_talente/Helmholtz-Juniors/Survey\_Report2019\_update.pdf](https://www.helmholtz.de/fileadmin/user_upload/06_jobs_talente/Helmholtz-Juniors/Survey_Report2019_update.pdf)  ), we have (as always) put these points into perspective and asked our DRs about power abuse and conflicts.
