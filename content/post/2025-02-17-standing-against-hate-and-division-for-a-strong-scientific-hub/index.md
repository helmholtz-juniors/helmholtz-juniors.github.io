Defending democratic values and preserving academic freedom sustainably strengthens Germany as a scientific hub with a future-oriented perspective. The upcoming federal election in particular, is a decisive moment for the future—and, therefore, for science as well. As an important scientific hub, Germany has the opportunity to establish itself as the innovation hub of the future. For this, democratic values, openness, diversity, and internationality are the key prerequisites.

Recent months have shown that right-wing populist parties repeatedly question the necessity of future-oriented research in fields such as social sciences, climate research, healthcare, and projects on diversity and migration. Attacks like these not only threaten academic freedom but also political advisory, which is essential for a future-oriented society, innovation, and economy. In contrast, open and democratic systems promote exchange between research institutions, industry, and politics, thereby laying the foundation for sustainable innovation.

Germany can only be an attractive international cooperation partner as a democratic, open, and tolerant country—because research thrives on dialogue. An open and diverse scientific culture fosters free thinking and a plurality of opinions—these are fundamental principles of democracy and essential for technological as well as societal innovation.

Therefore: Use your right to vote to secure an open, democratic, and future-oriented Germany!
