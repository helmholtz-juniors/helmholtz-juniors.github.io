Covering PHD Student issues, the [Helmholtz Juniors](https://www.helmholtz.de/en/career/careers-at-helmholtz/phd-candidates/helmholtz-juniors/) blog is run by the student representative group of the Helmholtz association. The PhD is a large part of life and often a time of great change for both the students undertaking one and those close to them. The balance of work and social life is often a challenge and can be an additional source of stress. This Blog aims to provide a source of information and a forum for discussion of current PHD issues both professional and social.
