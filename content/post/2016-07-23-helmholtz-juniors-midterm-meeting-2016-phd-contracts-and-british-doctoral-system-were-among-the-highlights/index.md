On July 13, the Helmholtz Juniors (you may know as HeJus) conducted their meeting in Berlin, which lasted for two days. More than 30 Juniors came from Helmholtz Centers all over Germany to join the Midterm Meeting taking place at the Helmholtz Association’s Headquarters (HGF) in Berlin.

For weeks before the meeting, the Juniors were preparing the agenda and gathering information across all centers and the HeJus working groups on the working conditions of PhD students and also the major problems that the students at each center are facing. The agenda of the Midterm Meeting included discussions on the PhD contract model that HeJus Working Conditions group has been working on, and a session by [Kyle Mayers](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/oes/postgraduate/research_students/km1g14.page) from the University of Southampton on the British doctoral system. The agenda also included the ongoing preparations for the soon coming Helmholtz PhD conference “[NextGen@Helmholtz](https://indico.scc.kit.edu/indico/event/229/overview)” taking place this September at HZI in Braunschweig. The HeJus met up with the new members joining this year.
