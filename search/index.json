[{"content":"Sustainable Cutting-Edge Research through Fair Working Conditions: The Necessity of Transparent Collective Agreements for Doctoral Researchers in the Helmholtz Association Recruiting top national and international talent is a major challenge in the highly competitive field of academic research and is of crucial importance to the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres (HGF). To succeed in the race for scientific progress, the HGF must offer attractive and reliable working conditions for its early-career researchers. In practice, however, individual contracts are predominantly concluded between the respective Helmholtz Centers and doctoral researchers, which reduces both the transparency of contract terms and the equal opportunity goals pursued by the HGF. As the voice of doctoral researchers within the HGF, the Helmholtz Juniors advocate for integrating all doctoral researchers employed at Helmholtz Centers into the collective agreement for the public sector (TVöD), pay grade E13. This is the only way to ensure fair and transparent working conditions and attract top-tier talent.\nThe following outlines the advantages of collective agreements over individual contracts, often referred to as funding agreements. In contrast, scholarships typically fail to provide the necessary social security and stability.\nCollective Agreements Create Transparency Science, as an international field of work, requires regulations that are transparent and understandable in an international context1. In a statement on the amendment of the Act on Temporary Scientific Contracts (WissZeitVG), the Alliance of Science Organisations in Germany warned against the risk of a confusing diversity of regulations and, in the worst case, disparities between institutions2. The Max Planck Society, for example, offers at least standardized (funding) contracts, whereas the HGF features a remarkable diversity of contracts for doctoral researchers. The most common type of contract in the HGF is individual, non-tariff agreements with durations of two to four years and compensation ranging from 55% to 100% of a full-time position. Only about a third of the centers apply the TVöD on an individual basis. Despite having an application agreement with the United Services Union (ver.di), two Helmholtz Centers effectively exclude doctoral researchers from the collective agreement by invoking § 1 para. 2 letter s of the TVöD. Two other centers are affiliated with universities due to their historical development and therefore apply the collective agreement for the public service of the federal states (TV-L), which uses a different pay scale. This inconsistent and arbitrary patchwork of rules not only prevents transparency but also creates inequalities among doctoral researchers within the HGF. This undermines equal opportunity and makes working conditions difficult to understand from an international perspective.\nCollective Agreements Ensure Equal Opportunity Improving equal opportunity is a central priority in the HGF - this principle is firmly anchored in the HGF\u0026rsquo;s mission and is an integral part of its talent management3. Through their uniformity, collective agreements are an important tool that can significantly promote equal opportunity across the HGF. Collective agreements establish a standardized minimum framework that is regularly negotiated publicly and applies to all doctoral researchers. They ensure standardized regulations for working hours and vacation, recognize professional experience in compensation, and provide social security through additional benefits such as occupational pension schemes. In contrast, individual contracts can vary significantly in content and are subject to the unilateral stipulations of funding bodies, such as the Federal Ministry for Research, Technology and Space (BMFTR), formerly the Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF), which define only maximum standards - allowing individual institutes to make downward deviations at their discretion. This opens the door to potential misuse and disadvantages for individual doctoral researchers. With collective bargaining, any changes to the agreement are automatically applied to all employment contracts. In contrast, individual contracts only reflect new rules in newly signed agreements. Thus, collective agreements ensure full transparency and lay the foundation for equal opportunity.\nCollective Agreements Increase Attractiveness and Satisfaction Sustainable and fair working conditions are not only key to long-term viability but also decisive for the lasting attractiveness and success of research institutions in an increasingly competitive academic landscape - a principle the Helmholtz Association already established in its 2016 sustainability management guidelines (LeNa). These guidelines emphasized the importance of developing new career paths and avoiding precarious employment, particularly for early-career researchers4. Competitive working conditions are the basis for attracting and retaining talented young scientists from both national and international backgrounds5,6.\nA 2020 study found that good working conditions and career prospects are key drivers of innovation in academic research7. Establishing good working conditions has twofold benefits: on the one hand, secure employment leads to higher satisfaction and productivity8; on the other hand, it enhances the employer’s appeal to international top talent. Job satisfaction is therefore a critical factor in the attractiveness of the public science sector. By introducing transparent, uniform contracts based on binding institutional application of the TVöD for doctoral researchers, the HGF can offer its early-career researchers sustainable, fair, and favorable working conditions - ensuring the retention of young talent amid a shortage of skilled workers in the public research sector.\nCollective Agreements Reduce Bureaucracy The 2023 inflation compensation payment demonstrated that the diversity of contract types results in increased administrative workload and uncertainty among doctoral researchers. Introducing the collective agreement for all doctoral researchers would simplify administrative processes and create independence from the directives of funding bodies such as the BMFTR, since collective bargaining law overrides ministerial guidelines and authorizations. This benefits both researchers and administrative staff, fosters a coherent and efficient organizational structure, enhances transparency, and strengthens the Helmholtz Centers\u0026rsquo; appeal as employers.\nConclusion In conclusion, we emphasize that the binding institutional application of the TVöD without exception for all doctoral researchers at all Helmholtz Centers is a necessary measure. It aligns with the interests of the HGF by increasing its competitiveness in recruiting national and international talent, ensuring high satisfaction and productivity among researchers, promoting equal opportunity, and simplifying administrative processes. By supporting this initiative, the HGF can further strengthen its position as a leading actor in research and innovation.\nThe Helmholtz Juniors represent around 8,000 doctoral researchers within the Helmholtz Association. They advocate for the introduction of collective agreements for doctoral researchers across the entire Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres.

The ability to communicate well is crucial for working efficiently and successfully- especially during a doctorate. It is well known that a doctorate comes with a multitude of challenges unrelated to the actual research itself. Young researchers often face problems that are not only related to completely neutral working topics but are also on a personal level, which brings emotions into the mix. This includes problems with co-workers and quite often with the supervisor.\nBeing emotionally involved makes it more challenging to communicate issues effectively and in a constructive manner. The real problem then is often not the actual problem, but rather the stimulated emotions. To make matters worse, communicating feelings at work is still sometimes perceived as unprofessional, weak, and inappropriate when precisely the opposite is true. Good communication is essential for maintaining not only a healthy working environment, but also good mental health and a free mind. In addition, learning how to communicate effectively leads to both personal and interpersonal growth. So, what IS the best way to communicate your problems and how it makes you feel?\nWhile there is no one single solution for all problems, here are some general pointers:\nBefore reacting impulsively with strong emotions, take a deep breath and try to distance yourself from the situation. Practice some self-awareness. What is it that you are feeling? Understand your own emotions, so you can express yourself more clearly. Depending on the situation, it might be helpful to talk to a trusted friend or colleague about the circumstances. Maybe write down what the problem is and how it makes you feel. Where did this problem originate, and do you have a solution you could propose? Do you think you can solve the problem by yourself? If not, don’t hesitate to tackle the issue.\nWhen addressing problems, remember: the time and place matter. Choose a moment when both parties are receptive. Talk somewhere where you will not be interrupted or disturbed. Both parties should take the time needed to discuss with no time limit.\nWhen communicating your problems, try to be as clear and specific as possible. Explain your problems and interests and if possible, give concrete examples. This helps the other party understand the issue and makes the issue tangible.\nPeople tend to quickly feel attacked, therefore when talking about the problem, use “I-statements”. Employ phrases such as “This gives me the feeling\u0026hellip;” or “This gives me the impression\u0026hellip;” and avoid direct confrontations like “You are\u0026hellip;” or “You always do XYZ\u0026hellip;”. Criticism in any situation should remain constructive. By staying with your emotions, it shifts the focus to your feelings and promotes empathy.\nTry to express how a problem is affecting you, how it makes you feel. This more constructive than blaming or attacking the other person directly, which should be avoided. Direct criticism of a person can hurt the other party, incite retaliation, and create even more problems.\nThere are different points of view for every problem. The main goal is for all parties to understand each others’ points of view. This can help deescalate the situation and hopefully lead to a resolution.\nListen to the other party and allow them to answer without interruption. Keep in mind that their feelings are also valid. Try to understand their point of view and listen to their interests. If the situation becomes emotional, make sure to stay calm and respectful to foster a more positive outcome. Be open to apologizing when needed or appropriate. Maybe the other party did react out of emotions as well and both of you can approach each other. Try to stay in the present with a focus on the future. Do not be too hung up on the past.\nThere are often dependencies in a working environment which you cannot easily dissolve or also do not intend to. That is why it is important to seek for a solution together which is suitable for all parties. Try to find areas of agreement upon which you can build.\nYou can use expressions such as: “I feel like we are stuck, and I understand that the underlying reasons could be this and this. I would need a more supportive collaboration, and therefore I would appreciate X and Y. Of course, I want to support you on the same level. What would you need? How can we improve the situation?”\nAfter communicating your problem, take some time and reflect on the situation and on what was discussed. Keep up the communication to ensure progress in resolving the problem.\nIf you feel that the communication barrier is too high, involving a mediator can be a good idea. This can be a supervisor, but also an ombudsperson. Companies and institutes do often have persons specially trained in helping handle and resolve such situations.\nUnfortunately, in some working environments, communicating your problems as a female comes with even more challenges such as being perceived as weak, and when speaking up, pushy. Here, it is important to not let yourself be silenced. If you face unjust criticism, stay consistent, stay strong. Such reactions say more about them and their inability to interface with strong women and less about you. In such situations it might be helpful to speak up and clearly reject such statements. Do not tolerate sexism at any point. Females communicating problems in a constructive, calm manner should not be subject to being called “tough” and “pushy” and being told to get out of their “victim-hood”. This is a failure in communication by the other party, and we suggest asking for a mediator or talking to a supervisor. Do not, however, let it stop you from communicating your problems.\nIn addition, communication styles differ from culture to culture. While Germans tend to have a very direct way of communication, this is different in other cultures. The German way of communication can be perceived as impolite or offensive. However, in some cultures, silence is a strong form of communication, which can be missed if one is unaware of such culture-specific cues. These cultural differences should always be kept in mind and considered, especially in our very international work environment.\n","date":"2025-03-24T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2025/03/how-to-communicate-your-problems/images/Blog-banner_hu_b113797ac35e29b7.png","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2025/03/how-to-communicate-your-problems/","title":"How to communicate your problems"},{"content":"Defending democratic values and preserving academic freedom sustainably strengthens Germany as a scientific hub with a future-oriented perspective. The upcoming federal election in particular, is a decisive moment for the future—and, therefore, for science as well. As an important scientific hub, Germany has the opportunity to establish itself as the innovation hub of the future. For this, democratic values, openness, diversity, and internationality are the key prerequisites.\nRecent months have shown that right-wing populist parties repeatedly question the necessity of future-oriented research in fields such as social sciences, climate research, healthcare, and projects on diversity and migration. Attacks like these not only threaten academic freedom but also political advisory, which is essential for a future-oriented society, innovation, and economy. In contrast, open and democratic systems promote exchange between research institutions, industry, and politics, thereby laying the foundation for sustainable innovation.\nGermany can only be an attractive international cooperation partner as a democratic, open, and tolerant country—because research thrives on dialogue. An open and diverse scientific culture fosters free thinking and a plurality of opinions—these are fundamental principles of democracy and essential for technological as well as societal innovation.\nTherefore: Use your right to vote to secure an open, democratic, and future-oriented Germany!\nHelmholtz Juniors Spokespersons 2025\n","date":"2025-02-17T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2025/02/standing-against-hate-and-division-for-a-strong-scientific-hub/images/We-stand-for-democratic-values_hu_fe31f5b9c106ac5d.png","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2025/02/standing-against-hate-and-division-for-a-strong-scientific-hub/","title":"Standing against Hate and Division – For a Strong Scientific Hub"},{"content":"- written by Thomas Gries\nWe as Doctoral Researchers (DRs) work in a highly competitive environment. In contrast to other professions, our tasks are not clearly defined. Instead, we have the liberty and the responsibility to balance a diverse range of activities such as practical lab work, data analysis, reading papers, writing papers, extracurricular activities, and much more.\nFrom time to time, this multitude of tasks can get overwhelming; most of us have experienced this first-hand. However, if this state of high stress prevails over extended durations with no recovery periods, we run the risk of experiencing \u0026ldquo;burnout\u0026rdquo;.\nTo put the term into context, we use the definition by psychologists H. Freudenberger and G. North, who introduced a first framework delineating the twelve stages of burnout in their book from 1992. Each of these stages is characterized by a set of symptoms that individuals may exhibit at the respective progression level. That being said, it is important to acknowledge that experiences and symptom severity may vary from individual to individual. The progression of burnout can manifest subtly and escape immediate recognition.\nNonetheless, the stages outlined below can provide orientation for assessing one’s risk of burning out:\nExcessive Ambition: Individuals often start with enthusiasm and high ambition. They have high expectations of themselves, aiming to achieve more than they realistically can. Increased Commitment: As the pressure to achieve these high-set goals intensifies, individuals push themselves to work harder and take on new tasks, often exceeding their physical and mental limits. Neglecting Own Needs: In pursuit of their objectives, individuals tend to overlook their own well-being, neglecting essential self-care practices such as adequate sleep, proper nutrition, and relaxation. Displacing (Private) Problems: Rather than addressing personal issues or stressors, individuals channel their focus and energy into work, using it to avoid confronting underlying problems. Revision of Values: The continuous stress and strain lead to a reassessment of personal priorities, where work takes precedence over other crucial aspects of life such as health, relationships, and hobbies. Emotional blunting and attention deficits may occur. Denial of New Problems: Even as new stressors arise, individuals may deny their significance or the toll that they take, attempting to persevere despite the mounting burdens. Withdrawal from Relationships: Feeling overwhelmed and emotionally drained, individuals start to withdraw from social interactions, isolating themselves and reducing communication with friends, family, and colleagues. Impact on Others: The growing burnout begins to affect not only the individual but also their relationships and interactions with others, causing strain and often altering the dynamics of their personal and professional connections. Depersonalization: To distance themselves from the stress and emotional cost, individuals may start perceiving themselves and others in a detached, impersonal manner, losing the sense of connection and empathy. Inner Emptiness: Over time, the persistent burnout leads to a profound sense of emptiness, where the individual struggles to find fulfillment or purpose in their work and/or life. Depression: The deepening emotional exhaustion and disillusionment can progress into a state of depression, characterized by constant feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities. An intense desire for extended sleep or even suicidal thoughts may develop. Full Burnout Syndrome: Finally, after enduring the various stages of burnout, individuals may reach a point of full burnout, experiencing a complete depletion of physical, emotional, and mental resources. This often requires significant intervention and support to recover from. If you feel like you have already progressed to some of the aforementioned stages, please take a step back. If you realize that one of your colleagues is increasingly displaying visible signs of burnout such as social withdrawal, it would be good to approach them and ask about their current situation. After recognizing burnout, seeking help and practicing self-care are crucial steps for recovery and for maintaining stable mental health.\nIt is important to realize that burnout is not a sign of weakness, but rather a natural response to overwhelming stress. Talk about your feelings and what you are experiencing with friends and family and/or seek professional help. Do more of what makes you happy and gives you energy. Say “no” more and draw clear boundaries – it may be difficult, but it is an important measure to prevent burnout. You are strong, and you WILL get through this! With time and support, you can find balance and happiness in your life again.

The idea of academic freedom dates back long ago, and in short, ascertains that academics can conduct and communicate their research or teach without the fear of repression, job loss, or imprisonment. However, job security and career perspectives have been found to be among the biggest drawbacks of scientific careers in Germany [1]. One important tool to regulate this within the German academic system is the Act on Fixed Term Employment Contracts in Academia (WissenschaftsZeitVertragsGesetz - WissZeitVG) [2].\nThe WissZeitVG regulates fixed term contracts. More precisely, it regulates the maximal duration one is allowed to be employed on a fixed term contract in academia. It does not regulate working hours, salaries, vacation days, etc. neither does it explicitly address working conditions, supervision of doctoral researchers, or project funding resources. It does not even regulate extensions, except defining an upper limit for the summed up contract time on fixed term contracts. So what\u0026rsquo;s all the fuss about if it\u0026rsquo;s “only about fixed-term contracts”?\nEven though the WissZeitVG mainly regulates maximum contract duration, this regulation causes far-reaching consequences for the academic environment. It impacts the structure of research institutions, where a professor and a handful of researchers reside in those limited permanent positions, whereas a large number of postdoctoral researchers, staff scientists, lecturers, and doctoral researchers – the ones, who are performing major parts of the scientific and higher educational work – are employed with fixed term contracts. And yes, for doctoral researchers, this is easily comprehensible, since they work towards a clearly defined qualification goal in order to graduate and then move on to a new chapter of their career. But for postdoctoral researchers, no such clear qualification exists, and they simply gain experience in their field of work, hoping to land one of those rare permanent positions. But it’s not just the structure of working groups, departments, or institutes, the funding system is also tailored to the current constraints given by the WissZeitVG. If these were now changed and all fixed-term contracts for postdoctoral researches were removed instantaneously, this would result in a collapse of the system. There are not enough permanent positions available nowadays and no additional funds to increase these numbers. The other extreme – allowing only unlimited fixed-term contracts in academia – would risk that highly skilled employees remain in uncertainty for their whole working life, always in fear of losing their job and either need to relocate far away from their homes or not finding new employment due to being overqualified. Aspects that can have a negative impact on their productivity and well-being. These and many more aspects need to be taken into account, when discussing the WissZeitVG.\nThe evaluation of the WissZeitVG, published in 2022, has shown the need of an amendment to prevent precarious working conditions in academia [3]. Details on the poor functions and precarious conditions in the current system can also be found in the 2021 National Report on Junior Scholars (BuWiN) [4]. Too many chain contracts, the majority of people on fixed-term contracts, and over 85 % leaving academia within 10 years after graduation of their doctorate. The constant fear of losing one’s job or not being able to get a subsequent contract. Not being able to plan one’s career in the long term without depending on fortunate circumstances. Sinking into work in order to perform best in the next evaluation, and putting in countless hours of unpaid overtime to do so. All this makes academia a precarious field of work. Seeing that many doctoral researches still have the ambition to pursue an academic career [5], is at odds with the number of positions available. However, it also shows that researchers are genuinely eager to contribute to science and thus to the benefit of society**.**\nThe WissZeitVG needs to give prospects for those who stay in academia, “permanency” on fixed-term contracts may not be the answer to that. Making an academic career more predictable may make it more attractive to those groups, which are currently underrepresented. Females, first-gen academics, and all of those who cannot take the risk to spend many years in precarious conditions or who do not have the financial protection to bridge the time between contracts. On the other hand, leaving academia in a shorter period of time after graduation can be beneficial to proceed with a career outside of academia and gain required experiences there.\nIf we were able to resolve all questions around the WissZeitVG in a blog post, the ongoing political process of the amendment of the act would not have been as tedious as it is. Finding solutions to problems arising in complex systems is not an easy task: and academia with its heterogeneity is a very complex system indeed. Here, we can only try to illustrate some aspects related to the topic, which might help to find a common ground for further discussions on the law itself. More detailed information on the position of HeJu and other doctoral researcher networks, as well as many other employee representations and unions who came together in a strong alliance can be found in our joint statement [6].\nNo matter how the new amendment of the WissZeitVG will look like, it can only set the direction for what the academic environment will look like in the future. Many more steps have to be taken. The funding scheme needs to be adjusted accordingly. If fixed-term contracts are allowed for shorter periods, we need more permanent positions, thus, more funding for these types of positions is needed. Since it is unlikely that the total amount of money available for academia will grow strongly as funding remains limited, we need to optimize the selection of people for permanent positions, and accompany them during their careers, starting when they are already students and doctoral researchers. Other options, like the utilization of the regular fixed-term contract act (Teilzeit- und Befristungsgesetz, TzB) for postdoctoral researchers may be taken into account, in particular when being equipped with exceptional conditions as in the case of young investigator group leaders or similar positions. We might even need to reconsider how “permanent” permanent positions will be. A permanent contract in academia will no longer be understood as a contract for the entire working life. Changing jobs within academia, since permanent positions are no longer the rare win in the lottery, will become normal. Breaking the one-way job transitions from academia to industry - but (almost) never vice versa - will lead to a more dynamic setting where people change jobs and contribute a broader range of skills. Academia will be benefiting if it adapts to the new rules. In times of skilled workers shortage, we cannot risk losing the best educated. And we need to provide attractive conditions for internationals to shift the brain drain into a brain gain, which will eventually benefit many more areas beside the academic field.\nFinally, no solution will meet all demands of all stakeholders, but we should not be afraid of substantial changes, if we want to truly improve the working conditions in academia. We shouldn’t make ill-advised decisions, and every possible adjustment of the WissZeitVG opens even more questions, which might need to be answered. Politicians have taken serious efforts to find a solution, which meets the expectations of employers and employees alike. We hope that they will continue to discuss with representatives of doctoral researchers, and listen to their advice as well as to the consultation of other parties involved.\nOne last point to keep in mind: The doctoral researchers, as well as Bachelor and Master students of today, are the first generation affected by the amendment of the WissZeitVG. They might be inexperienced in questions of funding schemes and contract details, but they know best how it feels to look into their own future.\nLet’s create a bright future for those bright minds, so that their academic endeavors are free again and not overshadowed by the fear of the extension.\nResources:\n[1] Germany from the outside\n[2] Gesetz über befristete Arbeitsverträge in der Wissenschaft\n[3] Evaluation des novellierten Wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetzes\n[4] 2021 National Report on Junior Scholars\n[5] N² survey 2021 report for the Helmholtz Association\n[6] N² position statement on the draft bill to amend the Act on Fixed Term Employment Contracts in Academia (WissZeitVG)\n","date":"2024-02-06T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2024/02/quo-vadis-academic-when-the-contract-expires/images/Joingt-Statment-WissZeitVG-170323-5_hu_5d7f6dc4212ddc36.png","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2024/02/quo-vadis-academic-when-the-contract-expires/","title":"Quo vadis academic, when the contract expires?"},{"content":"A tale of work-life-balance The day of a doctoral researcher (DR) consists of 9 h of work on average (according to N² Survey 2021). Contracts (or at least the paid part of them) only cover a fraction of that – most contracts cover about 6 h of work per day. Adding stress of having to publish, giving presentations, and other deadlines, the expectations of science do not leave much room for anything beyond. However, the workload of DRs is the biggest inducer of anxiety and followed closely by depression (see figure below). The lack of a good work-life-sleep balance is a key factor for a healthy life in the long run, but seems to be neglected during the doctoral research phase.\nWork-life balance is nothing new to me. My stuttering taught me at an early age that I need breaks from stress. If I don’t comply, if I don’t relax, it will just get worse. A simple equation. A simple reflection of my well-being – a reflection that I am not able to hide. That means that I need somewhat more time to relax and can not simply power through stressful periods without worsening my stutter. Current times supervisors expect you to work over 100 %. At the beginning of my doctorate, I tried to comply to it but failed miserably. I found myself at 6 to 7 hours per day – and sometimes extra hours on a Saturday. To that fragile balance I added a spokesperson-ship with the Helmholtz Juniors\u0026hellip;\nReactions from others were mostly the same: “Oh so you like pain?”, “You will never finish your project when you only look at the contract hours.” or “If you continue your voluntary work, you’ll lose focus for your project”. Being a member of the works council is a good thing, being part of the internal scientific board is an honour, but taking on similar roles as a DR should be kept for your free time or better not taken on at all\u0026hellip;\nFor me, this just made one problem obvious – a missing balance. The qualification phase should not only look at research but to educate academics, future supervisors and leaders. Meaning, most projects are just too big and the result is a high workload which is only manageable with the sacrifice of time one would need to recharge or to educate themselves.\nIn my opinion, these sacrifices would be totally avoidable if the qualification phase would not only include time for the project. The time for education, networking and gaining soft skills should not be something for our free time as it is part of the job – not an extra weight on your shoulders. The institute shoves education to the university as its their job to do so. But if I am expected to work 40 and more hours per week on my project, how am I supposed to work on my soft skills as a DR? When do I have time to network when I don`t get the time off to attend events with other DRs? When do I get time to recharge when I have to take vacation for educational courses? When can I relax when I am expected to write reports during my vacation? When does it all make sense?\nAn average of \u0026gt;40 h of work per week, an average of 4.5 years until the defence, 41 % of people don’t feel free to take vacation due to high workload or pressure from the supervisors. All these and more are facts among our DRs (according to the N² Survey 2021). Numbers of a missing balance, numbers of imbalance towards work.\nA Covid infection made this imbalance real to me. Out of order for two whole weeks, and my ability to focus vanished for a few more weeks. A full break for everything. Only then, I noticed how bad my stuttering got. I had not focused on myself for months on end, time to recharge always got cut short to finish mails, experiments or presentations. And now I got my limits shown to myself.\nSo who is responsible for the “life” in work life balance? Most institutes don`t care, most universities don`t care, most supervisors don`t care, most group leaders don`t care. It\u0026rsquo;s you. You have to care. Care for yourself. Care for your peers. You have to take the time you need to recharge, take time for education, take time for networking, take what is rightfully yours. It is not your fault the projects are not planned accordingly, but its your responsibility to care for your health.\nStay home when you are sick (check out „Vakanztage“, most institutes have it), go home when you loose focus, go home when you are tired and take your peers with you. Leave your laptop at home for vacation, don`t check mails when you are sick.\nMake sure that the academic imbalance of others does not take your balance.\n","date":"2023-10-13T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2023/10/the-academic-imbalance/images/Mental-health-awareness-month-1230-%C3%97-400px-5_hu_4be4f52dc7f9e194.png","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2023/10/the-academic-imbalance/","title":"The academic imbalance"},{"content":"send by BMBF on 14.06.2023\nWe, N2, the network of networks, the representatives of the doctoral researchers of the three non-university research institutions, the Helmholtz Association, the Max Planck Society and the Leibniz Association, welcome the efforts of the BMBF to create better conditions for researchers and academics with the presented draft for a new version of the German fixed term contract WissZeitVG.\nIndispensable for this is the incorporation of the experience of scientific personnel at all career levels. Their diverse backgrounds must also be sufficiently taken into account. Therefore, we present our statement in both German and English, and would welcome this approach from all parties involved in the discourse around WissZeitVG.\nThe present draft bill already contains some promising changes. We welcome the introduction of minimum terms for initial contracts allowing for longer-term planning at the beginning of each phase. The expansion of the compensation for disadvantages and the consideration of care can create windows of flexibility in these vulnerable areas and benefit diversity in science. All of these steps contribute to a better work environment and safety and would make Germany more attractive for (international) researchers.\nHowever, we feel like a wide range of problems that have been addressed in the evaluation of the WissZeitVG and extensively discussed with several stakeholders, including us, still remain unanswered. In alliance with initially ten organizations and now many more supporters, we have already formulated a statement with clear demands for an amendment of the WissZeitVG[1]. We would like to underline that the following points need to be reconsidered and enter the reformed act:\nStandard duration of six years, and a minimum of four years for doctoral contracts! While three years minimum contract duration is already an improvement, this does not yet correspond to the actual duration required for the successful completion of a doctorate, shown by several surveys like the BuWiN and the harmonized N2 survey 2021. With a minimum term of the initial contract of four years and a standard term of six years, the law would better reflect reality. Narrowing down the concept of qualification to the doctorate! In the existing version of the WissZeitVG, the concept of qualification is not a legally secure formulation (shown for example by the BAG verdict on the 02.02.2022). The present draft does not make any changes to this, and will thus not make it possible to guarantee legally secure fixed term employment for both doctoral researcher and postdocs in the future either. Thus, the practice of using the WissZeitVG to employ scientists on fixed-term contracts with vague qualification goals to fulfill permanent tasks, including doctoral researchers who have to work on tasks not related to their thesis, will continue. Only a narrowing of the concept of qualification to the doctorate and clearly defined qualification goals and contract requirements for doctoral candidates can change this. Long periods of fixed term contracts for postdocs need to stop! With the doctorate, the ability for fully independent work in academia is not always well-established. Also, different disciplines have very different requirements to achieve this. Therefore, we understand the motivation of the BMBF to design the postdoc phase with four years on a fixed term employment and additional two years, in case of a permanency assurance, which allows for example for a habilitation. Nevertheless, we must point out that the reform of the WissZeitVG cannot allow existing practices to continue, but must bring about an improvement. First and foremost, a long period of short term chain contracts and the first permanent position at an age over 40 years[2] hinders secure career and famliy planning. Also, not every scientific career has to end and can end in a professorship, and this goal does not have to be achieved exclusively by fixed-term positions. While the minimum contract period of two years serves the purpose of orientation, longer fixed-term periods without binding and comprehensible commitments run the risk of enabling abuse of postdocs for handling permanent tasks and hinder their career progress. Particularly with regard to the attractiveness of science compared to the non-academic labor market, this sends a devastating signal and damages the aspiration to be able to compete internationally. Complete lifting of the tariff ban! The separation of science from the rest of the labor market due to the partial continuation of the tariff ban represents an incomprehensible special position. The suggested partial removal only harms the employees’ side by reducing the minimum duration of contracts and does not allow for establishing transparent career progress goals or even extension criteria. Without the ability to negotiate on key factors, working conditions will worsen and make working in science and higher education unattractive and eventually drive brilliant minds out of academia or Germany. Full compensation for all disadvantages! Despite the improvements in the draft bill, the family and social policy components have not yet been expanded far enough. The inclusion of a care component is highly appreciated and will be of great importance in an increasingly aging society. However, compensations must apply to all employees under the WissZeitVG without exception. Not only those with a qualification reasoned fixed-term, but also those with third party funded fixed term employment, in particular if used to exceed the qualification time limit, need to benefit from these compensations. This is crucial in order to meet the special challenges of this particularly challenged group of employees. Demands of student employee representatives need to be met! The increase of the fixed term for student employees (SHK) from six to eight years and the introduction of minimum contract terms of one year are already a big step in the right direction. Nevertheless, they do not yet meet the demands of the representatives of student employees and we advise to continue to seek dialogue with them in order to do justice to another strongly underrepresented group in the discussions. An amendment of the WissZeitVG alone cannot renew the location of science (Wissenschaftsstandort Deutschland). The creation of permanent positions must now be included in the negotiation of funds. Further efforts must also be made to improve working conditions in science. These include the fair remuneration of doctoral researchers who still work in part-time employment and are not compensated for the additional work needed to fulfill the scope of their tasks. In order to be competitive and to not further aggravate the shortage of qualified workers, this must change. The practice of scholarships must also be questioned in order to counteract inequality.\nOnly through a determined joint effort from all sides can we continue to sustainably develop Germany as an attractive research location in the coming years and attract future generations to science, starting with today\u0026rsquo;s doctoral researchers.\n[1] https://blogs.helmholtz.de/hejus/2023/03/fuer-eine-umfassende-reform-des-wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetzes/\n[2] BuWiN 2021: 41.7 years for W2, 43.2 years for W3\n","date":"2023-07-03T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2023/07/n-position-statement-on-the-draft-bill-to-amend-the-act-on-fixed-term-employment-contracts-in-academia-wisszeitvg/","title":"N² position statement on the draft bill to amend the Act on Fixed Term Employment Contracts in Academia (WissZeitVG)"},{"content":"Written by Hugo Enrique Reyes Aldana\nMany of us are familiar with the famous Roman saying “Mens sana in corpore sano”, which could be translated into “a healthy mind in a healthy body”, and almost sure there is a translation in your native language in case Latin nor English is one of them. This reflects the fact that even in ancient times the health of the mind was as important as the health of the body. But at some point, that shifted. Mental problems became something to be hidden or neglected.\nOne of the reasons why mental health was long disregarded in discussions of health is the stigma attached to mental illness. The stigmatization of mental illness has been pervasive and long-standing in many cultures, often leading to individuals suffering in silence and not seeking help. Unfortunately, this is particularly true in academia, where the pressure to succeed, the competition for funding and positions, and the constant need to publish can all take a toll on one\u0026rsquo;s mental health.\nAcademia is known for its culture of perfectionism, where mental toughness is often equated with success. This mindset can lead individuals to ignore their mental health needs and feel ashamed or weak for experiencing mental health challenges by fearing judgment or discrimination from their colleagues and peers if they talk about their mental health struggles.\nThis stigma can have severe consequences, such as deterring individuals from seeking help, delaying diagnosis and treatment, and ultimately harming their overall health. To combat it, it is crucial to normalize discussions around mental health and acknowledge that challenges related to it are common and natural in academia. Seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.\nUniversities and academic institutions should prioritize resources and offer support for their students and staff. Mental health support should be easily accessible, affordable, and destigmatized. Additionally, research institutions should promote mental health awareness and provide education around to reduce the stigmatization of it and broaden its understanding.\nIt is also crucial to encourage open communication and support between colleagues and peers. Academic institutions should promote a culture of support and encourage individuals to share their mental health struggles with others, as sometimes building connections and empathize could help to ease the struggles. This can help reduce feelings of isolation and create a sense of community among those struggling with mental health challenges.\nAcademic institutions should also recognize and acknowledge the impact of academic stress and pressure on mental health. High-pressure academic environments can exacerbate existing mental health conditions or even create new ones. Therefore, it is essential to create a supportive and nurturing environment that prioritizes mental health and well-being.\nFor these and other reasons it that we as HeJus would like to contribute to this ongoing discussion and generate awareness during this month. Along it, we will be sharing content related to Mental Health that you will be able to find in the survey and well as our social media channels.

We welcome this step, but are disappointed with the content: the proposals at best alleviate the symptoms of the fixed-term system, but do not promise a cure.\nSetting appropriate, binding and concrete minimum contract periods, especially for initial contracts, and curbing chain contracts are important contributions to the necessary reform. But in the proposed compromises on maximum term limits, the original reason for reforming the law again has faded into the background: the lack of predictability of academic careers, both before and after the doctorate.\nThe initial reactions to the key issues paper have once again clearly shown that a comprehensive and well thought-out strategy is needed to create more permanent positions, fair and gender-equitable employment conditions, and predictable career paths for lecturers and researchers in the German higher education and research system. How this goal is to be achieved, however, remains unclear, even in many contributions to the debate that has now broken out. Last year, we already presented key points that pursue a holistic, clear approach and take into account both the interests of the employees we represent and the performance of the higher education and research system. This approach is currently more justified than ever. Contrary to the frequently claimed disagreement about the necessary reform steps, it must be emphasized once again that we, as a broad alliance of employee representatives, are taking a common position.\nWe demand…\nfor the doctoral phase, six years of standard contract duration, but at least four years of contract duration, legally designed as a Must rather than a should clause. The average doctoral period of 5.7 years (Federal Report on Young Academics, BuWiN) has not changed, not least because of the current practice of insufficient initial contract lengths and non-transparent criteria for contract extensions. In order to work in parallel towards the goal of shorter doctoral periods, better framework conditions must be created. This includes not only an appropriate contract structure that guarantees qualification during working hours, but also better structural support.\na clear narrowing of the term qualification to the doctorate in order to put an end to the gratuitous practice of fixed-term contracts. This will not only prevent possible abuse of fixed-term contracts, but also provide legal certainty for universities and research institutions as well as employees.\nfor the phase after the doctorate, either permanent employment or temporary employment with the promise of extension of the contract for an indefinite period of time upon fulfillment of specified requirements. The qualification for remaining in the science system is completed with the doctorate; at this point, the universities and research institutions must decide to whom they can offer a permanent perspective. If permanent employment does not follow immediately after the doctorate, a plannable path to a permanent position must be opened up and clearly defined. Simply poking around at the maximum term limit, as proposed in the BMBF\u0026rsquo;s key points paper of March 17, 2023, is counterproductive.\nthe deletion of the collective bargaining block unconditionally. As in other sectors, unions and employers in science and humanities must have the right to restrict fixed-term employment contracts to a comprehensible level in a collective agreement.\nuniform and binding regulations on compensation for disadvantages in the case of childcare, disability and chronic illness as well as disadvantages resulting from the corona pandemic. The existing legal entitlement to an extension of contract in the case of maternity leave, parental leave, leave to care for relatives, and leave to work as an equal opportunity representative or member of a staff committee must also apply without restriction in the case of third-party funding.\na standard contract period of at least two years for student assistants, as has functioned smoothly in Berlin for many years. The proposals of the BMBF cornerstone paper to improve the situation of student assistants are to be acknowledged, but unfortunately not sufficient.\nIn general, a considerable share of fixed-term contracts is due to third-party funding. Such a large share is neither in the sense of qualification nor in the sense of sustainable research, teaching and personnel development. This problem cannot be solved by amending the WissZeitVG. Instead, the federal and state governments must change the funding structure for universities and research and significantly increase the share of basic funding. In addition, universities and research institutions are called upon to use third-party pooling to create more permanent positions in the area of third-party funding.\nWe call on the BMBF to further develop its key points into guidelines for a comprehensive reform of the Fixed-Term Academic Contract Act in line with our joint statement and to prepare a corresponding draft bill without delay.\nThe signatory organizations:\nbukof – Bundeskonferenz der Frauen- und Gleichstellungsbeauftragten an Hochschulen (Federal Conference of Women’s Representatives and Equal Opportunities Representatives at Universities)\nBundesweite Tarifbewegung Studentischer Beschäftigter (TVStud) (Federal collective bargaining movement of student employees)\nDGB – Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund (German Confederation of Trade Unions)\nDGJ – Deutsche Gesellschaft für Juniorprofessur e.V.

Plädoyer für eine Reform des Befristungsrechts - ein gemeinsames Statement Die Wissenschaft in Deutschland ist in einer Krise und merkt es nicht. Es ist eine Krise des verschwendeten Potenzials ‒ eine Krise, die auf Kosten derjenigen ausgetragen wird, die das System maßgeblich tragen: der Wissenschaftler:innen ohne Professur. Unsicherheit und Zukunftsängste, Stress und zugespitzte Abhängigkeitsverhältnisse prägen den Alltag von Wissenschaft als Beruf. Obwohl inzwischen der Großteil von Forschung und Lehre von Wissenschaftler:innen ohne Professur gestemmt wird, sind verlässliche Arbeitsverhältnisse und berechenbare Perspektiven in der Regel nur für Professor:innen vorgesehen.\nWie produktiv könnte unsere Wissenschaft sein, wenn sie das Potenzial, das in unserem wissenschaftlichen Personal steckt, voll heben würde?\nWissenschaft ist nicht zuletzt Denkarbeit, Experimentieren und kritisches Hinterfragen. Doch das braucht Zeit ‒ und lässt sich mit Hektik und Zukunftsangst nur unter Qualitätsverlusten und Selbstausbeutung verbinden. Die Eigenheiten des akademischen Karriereweges betreffen dabei nicht alle gleich. Nach wie vor haben Machtverhältnisse anhand von Faktoren wie race, class, gender und abilty einen prägenden Einfluss auf Zugänge, Berufswege und Karrierechancen in der Wissenschaft.\nDie Arbeitsverhältnisse der Promovierenden und Postdocs werden heute überwiegend nach dem Wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetz (WissZeitVG) geregelt. Dieses Gesetz wurde 2016 novelliert und der Einfluss dieser Novelle auf die Arbeitsverhältnisse in mehreren (im letzten Monat) publizierten Studien untersucht. Die Ergebnisse sind ernüchternd: Eine Trendwende hin zu mehr unbefristeten Arbeitsverhältnissen ist ausgeblieben, der Anteil der Kurzzeitverträge mit Laufzeiten von einem Jahr oder weniger wurde nicht nachhaltig reduziert. Qualifikationszeiten sind von den Vertragslaufzeiten nicht annähernd gedeckt. Die Instrumente des Nachteilsausgleichs entfalten keine verlässliche Wirkung. Die unterzeichnenden Organisationen sind deshalb überzeugt, dass jetzt eine mutige und grundlegende Reform des Sonderbefristungsrechts für die Wissenschaft notwendig ist.\nEckpunkte für mehr Planbarkeit und Chancengleichheit der Berufswege in der Wissenschaft:\nDer Qualifizierungsbegriff im WissZeitVG muss eng geführt und juristisch bindend definiert werden. Eine Anstellung zur Promotion kann eine Befristung begründen. Für andere Qualifizierungsziele als Begründung für eine befristete Beschäftigung sehen wir in dieser Phase keine Berechtigung. Mit dem Eintritt in die Postdoc-Phase sollte in der Regel ein unbefristeter Arbeitsvertrag oder zumindest ein planbares Verfahren zur Entfristung in der Wissenschaft verbunden sein. Beschäftigte, deren Arbeit von Daueraufgaben geprägt ist, müssen auf Dauerstellen beschäftigt werden. Vertragslaufzeiten müssen den angestrebten Qualifikationszielen entsprechen. Wie die Evaluationen eindrucksvoll zeigen, ist dies nicht der Fall: Mittlere effektive Vertragslaufzeiten bei Promovierenden von etwa 20 Monaten bei einer durchschnittlichen Promotionszeit von 4,7 Jahren (vgl. Bundesbericht Wissenschaftlicher Nachwuchs 2021) zeigen, dass die WissZeitVG-Novelle von 2016, an ihren eigenen Zielen gemessen, gescheitert ist. Die durchschnittlichen Qualifizierungszeiten sollten daher fächerspezifisch regelmäßig erhoben werden, um auf dieser Grundlage verbindliche Vorgaben zu machen. Unverbindliche Gesetzesformulierungen sind offenkundig nicht ausreichend. Verlängerungen der Höchstbefristungsdauer (§ 2 Absatz 1 Sätze 4-6 WissZeitVG) führen, wie die Evaluation gezeigt hat, bisher kaum zu faktischen Vertragsverlängerungen und sollten als Rechtsansprüche der Beschäftigten neu ausgestaltet werden. Verlängerungsansprüche sollten hierbei für alle Beschäftigten zugänglich sein, die mit dem Ziel angestellt werden, eine Qualifizierung zu absolvieren. Die Tarifsperre muss aufgehoben werden. Nur beim Thema Befristung in der Wissenschaft ist den Sozialpartnern durch das Arbeitsrecht verboten, wesentliche Fragen der Arbeitsbedingungen tariflich zu regeln. Dies steht im eklatanten Widerspruch zum im Koalitionsvertrag verankerten Ziel der Bundesregierung, die Tarifautonomie zu stärken.

The German scientific system is in such a crisis but does not seem to recognize it. It’s a crisis of wasted potential, a crisis to the detriment of those who help to carry the system. From the outside, science in Germany appears to be continuous and reliable, but this façade only hides serious problems. For example, Doctoral Researchers (henceforth DRs) disproportionately often suffer from depressive symptoms (our studies: Leibniz, Helmholtz und Max-Planck). These DRs are the undisputed backbone of the German scientific system. Moreover, together with Postdocs, they compose the majority of scientific staff. Nonetheless, their needs, worries and fears find comparatively little consideration when it comes to the design of structures and organizational culture in science. This way, a lot of potential remains unused.\nHow productive could our research be if the system granted its scientific staff an adequate working environment? How much potential could we utilize?\nScience is primarily mental work. But especially mental capacities are negatively impacted by uncertainty and anxiety about the future. Currently and in most cases, the working conditions of DRs and Postdocs are regulated by the WissZeitVG -a law that is meant to set the general framework for scientists’ temporary employment conditions. In 2016, this law was amended and today the evaluation of this amendment has been published (evaluation report). The primary justification for any temporary contract according to the WissZeitVG is “qualification”, a term which is, however, legally not closer defined. And that’s already this law’s core issue. Most institutions (56.8%) have not developed any guidelines for qualification goals (Figure 10 of the evaluation report). We do not doubt that the time of doing a doctorate is a qualification phase. However, when scientists enter the Postdoc phase, it is already more difficult to define the qualification goals. For that matter, in most cases, habilitation is used as justification (56%, Table 13 of the evaluation report). This appears absurd considering that only a minority of those scientists can receive a professorship (max. 3% of Postdocs).\nThe primary goal of the WissZeitVG 2016 amendment was to prohibit “inappropriate short-term contracts” and to create a reliable framework for the limitation of work contracts. Unfortunately, this goal has not been reached. After a brief period of time (2015 - 2017), in which average effective contract durations became longer, there appeared to be a relapse from 2017 to 2020 such that contract durations went back to the same level that was observed prior to the amendment. In case of PhD staff of non-academic science organizations (AuF) and of the university of applied sciences (HAW), average contract durations even decreased from 2015 to 2020 (Figure 1). The stipulated contract durations are not appropriate for DRs either. In their case, average effective contract durations are at 20 months regardless of the organization, even though the average doctoral research project actually takes 4.7 years, thus 55 months, in Germany (Buwin; Abb. B46). In sum, this evaluation depicts that inappropriate short-term contracts are still the norm in science.\nDurations of projects financed through third parties usually are longer than the respective work contracts (Figure 58 of the evaluation report). Therefore, employers are not fulfilling their duty, which is specified in WissZeitVG §2 Passage 2, where it says that the \u0026ldquo;[\u0026hellip;] stipulated contract duration shall correspond to the project duration\u0026rdquo;.\nThese poorly projectable and uncertain working conditions lead to anxiety about the future, self-exploitation and, eventually, to psychological stress for DRs and Postdocs.\nThe consequence is that many clever minds are leaving science, taking their ideas and methods with them. The holes they leave behind will become noticeable.\nWhich potential is hiding in our scientific institutions? We don’t know! To allow for good research, a good foundation needs to be set. In light of the challenges, which will concern us in the 21st century, and already concern us, we need the best possible scientific apparatus. This starts with the scientific staff and their working conditions.\nCo-author: Jacob L.

Together with the other three PhD networks we form the network of networks – N², summing up to a total of about 16,000 doctoral researchers.\nLast year about 30% of the DRs participated, which means about 4,800 DRs filled out the whole survey. That’s quite good considering the sheer number of DRs, but still like a puzzle that’s not continued with many pieces missing just because you can see the bigger picture; a lot of details get lost in the process.\nAnd that’s why this year, we have the goal of 50% participation rate: to see more detail, to allow statistical outliers become patterns, to make our analysis and interpretations even more underpinned than last surveys. But to achieve this, we need every opinion that there is, every possible outcome of the survey, every piece of information.\n#RaceTo50\nWhat’s the topic?\nThe last 1 ½ years were especially hard for all of us. No field work, no coffee with the colleagues, no chat about your ideas in the hallway, long waiting lists for analysis time, no networking with international colleagues on conferences, no barbeque with the newcomers, isolating conditions of home office, screwed up work-life-sleep balance, …\nCovid-19 did affect all of us, exacerbated worries that already existed and producing a cohort of worried DRs concerned about completion and quality of their work, worried about their career path and options, worried about their future.\nThis year’s survey will have a bunch of questions about your life and your work during the pandemic, impacts on social environment, navigation of a doctoral thesis, emotional, technological and logistical problems that came up and multiple other factors.\nBut the thing is, everyone of us had different problems. We do not see or hear everything. There are just too many factors that can change everything, too many variables, too many mutual dependent conditions. And that’s why we want to hear about your life adjustments, your problems, your ideas to amend the situation: to figure out typical phenomena, reoccurring patterns, intersecting sets of problems.\nAnd what’s the use of this effort?\nThis survey is indeed a huge effort. It takes a long time to prepare it (props to our Survey Team!) as well as to evaluate it – not considering the amount of time summing up all the 30 min of filling out a survey from thousands of participating DRs. So why do we stem all this work? Easy: to make a change!\nPast results have been featured in press conferences and published in journals, newspapers, blogs, and radio stations all over Germany and worldwide. Examples are the Tagesspiegel, Deutschlandfunk or the podcast SWR2 Wissen. A summary of the results was even published in Nature. These publications got us an invitation to the Bundestag as experts and meetings with the Federal Ministers of Education and Research (BMBF).\nThis means the problems of our DRs, your problems, get attention in the highest institutions of Germany and the scientific community in general. This fact is encouraging us to go forward with all the voices we can gather and change the world of young researchers for the better.\nBut therefore, we need the data, we need all voices, we need your voice.\n","date":"2021-09-13T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2021/09/its-all-about-the-data/images/survey_hu_8ba0e25ccb00e450.png","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2021/09/its-all-about-the-data/","title":"It’s all about the data!"},{"content":"During our HeJu annual meeting 2021 (online) on 28th Jan, we elected our new HeJu steering committee as well as working group speakers for the term 2021-2022.\nWe thank our previous steering committee -

For instance, even within the same discipline, the researches we do still need certain extent of novelty so that many of us might never find some one doing exactly the same thing and have an in-depth chat about our passions. On the other hand, being doctoral researchers can also bring us a solidary benefit. We are that many (even within the Helmholtz society, there are currently about 8,500 DRs) and the greater challenges (beyond our specific research topic) are so similar for all of us (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03459-7). Thus, staying connected with our peer DRs through networks as well as showing the representative status quo of our DR community is crucial to improve our living/working conditions.\nSo here is an example we have done as Helmholtz Juniors (HeJu) for showing our representative status quo of our DRs. We conduct a Helmholtz-wide PhD survey every two years and publish the results. We also communicate with the administrative units at each center by our local HeJu representatives and try to promote the living/working conditions for our DRs.\nOur newest survey report is here: https://www.helmholtz.de/fileadmin/user_upload/06_jobs_talente/Helmholtz-Juniors/Survey_Report2019_update.pdf\nAnd below is the interview with our survey team to explain you our motivation and execution:\nEnjoy!\nFollow us and keep up2date with our work!\nhttps://www.helmholtz.de/karriere_talente/wissenschaft/promovierende/helmholtz_juniors/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/helmholtz.juniors/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/helmholtz.juniors/\nhttps://twitter.com/helmholtzjrs/\n","date":"2020-11-16T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2020/11/check-out-the-interview-1/5-here-our-heju-survey-team-explains-you-the-motivation-and-execution-of-our-2019-heju-survey/images/Picture1_hu_1540857a2fe7dc85.png","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2020/11/check-out-the-interview-1/5-here-our-heju-survey-team-explains-you-the-motivation-and-execution-of-our-2019-heju-survey/","title":"Check out the interview (1/5) here!

There have been enough studies talking about “we need to pay attention to our students\u0026rsquo; mental health” [1], and that’s good. Mental health is a topic that is often overlooked or even dismissed. Very often we have to deal with the feeling of constant failure, impostor syndrome, heavy expectations and it is just overwhelming. Also, the requirements for a good PhD such as learning a lot of new things and dealing with many complex and large projects combined with stressful situations in the lab and private life can sometimes make it hard to cope. Add to that the whole process of moving to another country, as around 40% of is Doctoral Researchers in the Helmholtz Association have [2] – leaving friends and family behind. And that can be an additional burden to carry.\nYou are not alone!\nLet’s face it: you have probably experienced at least one of these real bad moments during your PhD. So, the first thing we want to make sure you know is that you are not alone.\nEspecially during these crazy recent times of a worldwide pandemic.\nLet us not ignore the importance of staying healthy in both mind and body.\nMental Health Awareness Month\nThe Helmholtz Juniors wants to invite you to join us this October for our Mental Health Awareness month!\nOur post series (in parallel, same email series were sent to all Helmholtz Docs on every Thursday) bundles a lot of information and good practices to keep your minds healthy. Furthermore, we discuss the current state of Doctoral Researchers‘ mental health in Germany and around the world. We provide information on how to identify possible stressors and signs of stress in your life as well as some potential tips on how to be happy.\nStay tuned for our mental health awareness posts!\nEnjoy this reading as it will be a great opportunity for a precious 5 min break from work.\nHelmholtz Juniors: the PhD network working to improve our situation\nWondering about the origin of this campaign? Let us introduce ourselves: we are the Helmholtz Juniors, the PhD network of the Helmholtz Association. We represent around 8000 Doctoral Researchers to the head office and the public, and our efforts focus on assessing and improving our situation during the PhD. You might have heard of some measurable results from our work, such as the general increase of salaries and implementation of contracts instead of stipends.\nLet us together destigmatize mental health and do the first step together: Let’s talk about it! But also remember, help can be right there, with a very long and deep breath and a simple and easy chit chat with a fellow Doctoral Researcher who might have been there already and can share some experience.\nAnd finally: you survived 100% of your worst days so far. Congratulations on that! So take a moment, sit back, breathe and relax. You deserve it. Additional Information that we want to share:\nThe University of Jena is hosting a Mental Health Webinar Series starting next Monday with a 7 interesting topics!\nBe sure to check their programm:\nhttps://www.uni-jena.de/forschung/exzellenzstrategie/jena+alliance+life+in+focus/mental+health+day+2020+webinar+series\nAll the best!\nThe Mental Health Awareness Month post series is brought to you by Helmholtz Juniors\nWe thank Pedro Ivo Silva Batista (DESY), Martin Schrader (HZDR), Michaela Löffler (UFZ), Nicolas Stoll (AWI), Fabian Wolf (GEOMAR), Younes Bouhadjar (FZJ), Stephanie Taylor (DZNE), Khwab Sanghvi (DKFZ), Lukas Kreis (GSI), Johannes Nelles (UFZ), Vasundhra Shaw (DESY) and Olya Oppenheim (MDC) for the text and Marlene Härtel (HZB), Martin Schrader (HZDR), Anna-Lena Amend (HMGU) and Xin You (UFZ) for the design.\nFollow us and keep up2date with our work!\nhttps://www.helmholtz.de/karriere_talente/wissenschaft/promovierende/helmholtz_juniors/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/helmholtz.juniors/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/helmholtz.juniors/\nhttps://twitter.com/helmholtzjrs/\nReferences\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03489-1 https://www.helmholtz.de/fileadmin/user_upload/06_jobs_talente/Helmholtz-Juniors/Survey_Report2019.pdf ","date":"2020-10-29T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2020/10/heju-mental-health-awareness-month-oct-2020-welcome/images/Welcome-banner_blog_hu_659a9a216b1d0cf1.jpg","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2020/10/heju-mental-health-awareness-month-oct-2020-welcome/","title":"HeJu Mental Health Awareness Month (Oct 2020) - Welcome"},{"content":"We often talk about heart and lung health, etc. but we seldom talk about brain health which is undeniably central to all our health. The brain is like any other organ. During our Mental Health Awareness month we actually talk a lot about stress. Stress is often portrayed as having only relatively short lasting psychological impacts, but it also alters the biochemistry happening in your body and especially your brain and therefore actually having also long lasting physiological impacts.\nSo, if you properly take care of it, you will reap the most fulfilling benefits. As the renounced neuroscientist Dr Daniel Amen said:\n“When your brain works right, you work right and when your brain is troubled your life is troubled” [10].\nSo, then the question is how someone can improve ones brain health?\nBelow are the most important practices, according to a various number of studies, for an ultimately better brain health:\nSleep \u0026amp; Relaxation\nGood sleep is the backbone of all brain health [16]. Without good sleep, your brain cannot function. Memory loss, for instance, is often associated with a lack of sleep. When you are sleeping, a structure in the brain called the hippocampus recalls and consolidates recent memories - and without sleep, this natural process is halted [4]. Furthermore, during sleep, the brain gets rid of waste products such as beta-amyloid, which if aggregated to plaques is associated with Alzheimer’s disease [7]. Sleep also improves mood and the immune system and may lead to weight loss [5,6].\nFood \u0026amp; Nutrition\nCells all over your body need to produce ATP – aka the “energy molecule”. During this process, the cells release free radicals. Excess free radicals can lead to oxidative stress and damage of cells - including nerve cells (oxidative stress) [8]. The main factor that increases or decreases the number of free radicals in your blood is food. Healthy food, especially vegetables, which are full of antioxidants like broccoli and spinach, decrease free radicals [13]. Unhealthy food normally contain high amounts of sugars and carbohydrates which can increase the number of free radicals.\nHealthy food can also improve the necessary chemistry of the brain leading to better cognition. For example, healthy fats like Omega 3 have been shown to improve memory while also being beneficial for the whole body [9].\nPhysical Exercise\nExercising 20 min a day doing any kind of aerobic activity has shown to have great benefits [12]. It makes the cells of your body much stronger and less prone to oxidative stress. It also improves blood flow to the brain and hence more oxygen and nutrients delivered to the nerve cells. Exercise also stimulates chemical changes in the brain that enhance learning, mood and thinking.\nMeditation\nStudies show that practising meditation regularly has great benefits. It helps not only managing stressful situations but also improves memory. In one study it is shown that meditation changes the structure of the brain [2]. It increases the volume of the hippocampus which is responsible for learning and memory and decreases the volume of the amygdala which is responsible for fear and anxiety. If this got you interested and you want to get started with meditation, take a look at these two books [11,15].\nSocial Interaction\nIn a shocking study, a group from Harvard medical school reported that feelings of loneliness may have detrimental consequences on cognition, e.g memory loss [3]. Being engaged in social activity is an important pillar of your brain health. Try at least to stay in touch with your family and friends.\nFinally, we would like to recommend these two books [10,17], which are full of tips and good practices that boost your brain health.\nAll the best!\nThe Mental Health Awareness Month post series is brought to you by Helmholtz Juniors\nWe thank Pedro Ivo Silva Batista (DESY), Martin Schrader (HZDR), Michaela Löffler (UFZ), Nicolas Stoll (AWI), Fabian Wolf (GEOMAR), Younes Bouhadjar (FZJ), Stephanie Taylor (DZNE), Khwab Sanghvi (DKFZ), Lukas Kreis (GSI), Johannes Nelles (UFZ), Vasundhra Shaw (DESY) and Olya Oppenheim (MDC) for the text and Marlene Härtel (HZB), Martin Schrader (HZDR), Anna-Lena Amend (HMGU) and Xin You (UFZ) for the design.\nFollow us and keep up2date with our work!\nhttps://www.helmholtz.de/karriere_talente/wissenschaft/promovierende/helmholtz_juniors/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/helmholtz.juniors/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/helmholtz.juniors/\nhttps://twitter.com/helmholtzjrs/\nReferences\nhttps://healthybrains.org/pillars/ Hölzel, B.

The mental health of Doctoral Researchers has been increasingly analysed during the last years, often with alarming results. Major concerns regarding the well-being of early career researchers are depression, anxiety, harassment and a difficult work-life balance.\nWhat do studies say?\nThe Graduate Assembly (2014) reported that 47% of Doctoral Researchers of the University of California, Berkeley met the threshold for depression. A recent study by Levecque et al. (2017) analysed the situation of more than 3000 Doctoral Researchers in Belgium and found that the risk for psychiatric disorders in academia is higher than in other highly-educated groups. 32% of Doctoral Researchers are at risk of a common psychiatric disorder, such as depression. Main reasons were work-family interfaces, job demands and job control, and the leadership style of the supervisor (Levecque et al., 2017).\nIn a Nature study, 29% of 5700 Doctoral Researchers listed mental health as an area of concern, with half of them getting help for depression or anxiety caused by their PhD study (Woolston, 2017). A follow-up Nature study in 2019 showed that things seem to get worse; 36% of 6300 PhDs from all around the globe seeking help for depression and anxiety related to their PhD project. Also, one-fifth reported bullying, while another fifth experienced discrimination or harassment (Nature, 2019).\nThe EPFL Doctoral III survey (2019) draws a similar image, 20.7% of the 1043 participating Doctoral Researchers experienced bullying or behaviours that may constitute as bullying, which includes aggressive behaviour, being undermined and being isolated and ignored by people at work. Symptoms of depression were associated with experienced bullying behaviour. If there is evidence of bullying more than 90% of respondents showed depressive symptoms (EPFL, 2019). Another reason for the critical mental health situation is that success is measured in publications, citations, funding and impact. The autonomy of research is reduced or removed when funding, publications and impact are part of the universities formal monitoring and evaluation system, and when supervisors judge the failure or success of Doctoral Researchers (Nature, 2019).\nWhat did we find?\nDuring the 2019 Helmholtz Juniors survey, we tried to get an overview of the mental health of all Doctoral Researchers within the Helmholtz Association. The survey used a shortened STAI questionnaire. The high number of working hours - 66 % work more than 41h while even 18 % work more than 50 h a week - and high conflict potential - 16 % reported conflicts with superiors are critical influences on the mental health of young Doctoral Researchers.\nAnalysis of the questionnaire indicated 22 % showed signs of moderate to severe depression and 70 % showed signs of moderate to high state anxiety.\nThe results are, sadly, similar to the findings of the already presented studies.\nBut the first step on finding solutions and ways to tackle a problem is knowing about it in the first place!\nWe´re working on various strategies, as Helmholtz Juniors on our own, as well as in joined projects with individual centres and of course with the Helmholtz Association’s Headquarters in Berlin.\nAnd we would like to hear your opinion on that topic!\nWhat do you think are the biggest challenges for keeping a good mental Healh while doing your PhD or in science in general?\nHave you encountered a hostile workplace atmosphere?\nDo you want to help us create a more sustainable work environment in academic research?\nWe would love to hear your thoughts and ideas!\nAll the best!\nThe Mental Health Awareness Month post series is brought to you by Helmholtz Juniors\nWe thank Pedro Ivo Silva Batista (DESY), Martin Schrader (HZDR), Michaela Löffler (UFZ), Nicolas Stoll (AWI), Fabian Wolf (GEOMAR), Younes Bouhadjar (FZJ), Stephanie Taylor (DZNE), Khwab Sanghvi (DKFZ), Lukas Kreis (GSI), Johannes Nelles (UFZ), Vasundhra Shaw (DESY) and Olya Oppenheim (MDC) for the text and Marlene Härtel (HZB), Martin Schrader (HZDR), Anna-Lena Amend (HMGU) and Xin You (UFZ) for the design.\nFollow us and keep up2date with our work!\nhttps://www.helmholtz.de/karriere_talente/wissenschaft/promovierende/helmholtz_juniors/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/helmholtz.juniors/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/helmholtz.juniors/\nhttps://twitter.com/helmholtzjrs/\n","date":"2020-10-29T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2020/10/heju-mental-health-awareness-month-oct-2020-exposing-the-problem/images/mental-health_hu_6db3a13da31fe386.png","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2020/10/heju-mental-health-awareness-month-oct-2020-exposing-the-problem/","title":"HeJu Mental Health Awareness Month (Oct 2020) – Exposing the problem"},{"content":"\nHow to be happy?\n„If only we’d stop trying to be happy we’d have a pretty good time.“\nEdith Wharton\nThis topic is quite a controversial and also philosophical one. Let´s be honest here: we can´t guide you to fundamental happiness. There´s no neat trick that works for everyone. If so it would be a more peaceful and relaxed world. What we want to do is make you think. Because even if you´re totally against everything we will write down here: thinking about it may bring you a step further to your version of happiness. So join us on this ride!\nWhile being happy might be the ultimate goal and achievement of everyone’s life, achieving true happiness is not that simple. The term Happiness can be divided into basically two varieties. The first is a short term, nearly ecstatic rush of Happiness. This Happiness-rush is quite a cruel creature – once you were able to capture a glimpse of it, it is gone already again.\nSo would it be recommended at all, to chase the illusion of a life that consists only out of happy moments?\n„Gotta have a little sadness once in a while so you know when the good times come.“\nBob Ross\nThe second variety is the long term, innerly peacefull and lasting happiness. And that is the variety of happiness that is more sustainable. While the ecstatic happiness rushes are what spice up life, the fundamental happiness is the one that makes you feel satisfied. The one that let´s you feel relaxed, being balanced and in peace with yourself.\nLife can be exhausting, boring and full of dickhe… ahem, people that are hard to get along with. But life can also be full of joy, fun and full of nice and great people.\nYou are the one that defines your very own life.\nAnd yes, this is a hell of a task. Most likely the most important and hardest task you ever signed yourself up for.\nHere are three questions you can ask yourself to align your course to destination Happiness, and they might help you to get this task done in the best way possible!\nWhat are you working for?\nMight it be solely to be able to pursue a luxury lifestyle, three times extravagant holidays a year, a sports car that goes from 0 to 100 in a blink of an eye? Or might it to be able to provide a good life for your family. Or doing your part in changing the world with your very own everyday science – hopefully to the better.\nThose aims are extremely diverse and your very own. They will also change often in life – but being aware for what YOU are working so hard for whatever it might be will help you to keep being motivated. And you then also know, what you really WANT to spend your money on. And please, don´t feel sad because you feel like the lifestyle you pursued 10 years ago was wasteful – it was the lifestyle you wanted to live and that brought you (hopefully) joy those days.\nWhat are you passionate about?\nBeing passionate about what you´re doing is one of the most crucial things when it comes down to joyfulness and in the greater scheme happiness. If you´re passionate about what you´re doing, then work goes easy and you actually like to work and furthermore – it doesn´t feel like work. But it´s not obligatory to be passionate about your work. If you´re passionate about beer, coffee or deliciousness in general – be passionate! If you´re passionate about motorsports, skiing or any other sport – be passionate! If you´re passionate about video games and/or eSports – be passionate! If you´re passionate about arts, painting, sculpting or craftsmanship - be passionate!\nEspecially Hobbies are there to bring joy – and not meant to generate any income. Although this doesn´t exclude each other.\nPassion is the spark that lit the fire in your heart for a specific topic – and also keeps it burning!\nWhy do I chase Happiness?\nAlthough this sounds controversial: happiness is, most of the time, only short-lasting – those rushes we talked about earlier. Happiness is what you feel when you had a good experiment, got compliments, won some poster prize or won a game of Monopoly. Chasing this kind of happiness means, only wins, only great results and only external love from other people will count – and they´re hard to get. And if those don´t happen, you´re starting to feel unhappy until you get a glimpse of it again. You can´t really chase happiness.\nThe key, in our opinion, is to chase joy. You can feel joyful for doing a good job for yourself. You can feel joyful while playing the game – although you might not win it. You can feel joyful in appreciation that you were invited to speak to a broad audience that are all experts in their fields. And you will feel joyful by doing something you´re passionate about. You will feel joyful treating yourself with something from your bucket or wish list. You might feel joyful if you enjoy a beautiful sunset with a beautiful cup of coffee in your hands. Go and enjoy.\nGo and chase joy instead of happiness. Because that way, fundamental happiness will be your most loyal companion.\nThis post is also the last one of our Mental Health Awareness Month post series. We honestly hope it lit a spark of thought on this important topic. And that you and your mental health benefit from it.\nRemember: You Are Not Alone!\nAll the best!\nThe Mental Health Awareness Month post series is brought to you by Helmholtz Juniors\nWe thank Pedro Ivo Silva Batista (DESY), Martin Schrader (HZDR), Michaela Löffler (UFZ), Nicolas Stoll (AWI), Fabian Wolf (GEOMAR), Younes Bouhadjar (FZJ), Stephanie Taylor (DZNE), Khwab Sanghvi (DKFZ), Lukas Kreis (GSI), Johannes Nelles (UFZ), Vasundhra Shaw (DESY) and Olya Oppenheim (MDC) for the text and Marlene Härtel (HZB), Martin Schrader (HZDR), Anna-Lena Amend (HMGU) and Xin You (UFZ) for the design.\nFollow us and keep up2date with our work!\nhttps://www.helmholtz.de/karriere_talente/wissenschaft/promovierende/helmholtz_juniors/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/helmholtz.juniors/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/helmholtz.juniors/\nhttps://twitter.com/helmholtzjrs/\nAnd for all that loyal companions that read through all:\n#HeJuCat\nAnd if you still feel a bit down, here´s something that should cheer you up:\nhttps://youtu.be/rZcmIMypGkg?t=9\n","date":"2020-10-29T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2020/10/heju-mental-health-awareness-month-oct-2020-how-to-be-happy/","title":"HeJu Mental Health Awareness Month (Oct 2020) – How to be happy?"},{"content":"Stressors can be various, but for Doctoral Researchers, it mostly starts with a high workload and high expectations – which potentially activates a downwards spiral: This can lead to less time for hobbies (friends, sports etc.), which can be leading to sleeplessness and therefore tiredness and in the end potentially social isolation. But everyone deals with stress differently. Some seem pretty robust when it comes to stress – mainly because they´ve learned how to personally deal with stress. While some seem very prone to stress and react with severe psychological as well as physiological symptoms. In the end, nobody is immune to stress.\nHave you been waking up in the middle of the night because you were thinking about a project you need to finish soon? Do you feel overrun because you can´t keep up with the project outline? Do you feel chased by deadline after deadline? Are you feeling tired a lot? Do you have twitching muscles, like your eyelids or fingers? Has your appetite changed? Have you gained or lost a lot of weight? Have you felt struggled to concentrate on work? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then you are probably stressed.\nPeople tend to overlook these early signs or do not take them seriously. We think, in a few days everything will be fine again. We think we need to function or otherwise we´re worthless. We think our whole future depends on this one talk we have to hold within the institute.\nBut often these signs last - and you slowly start getting used to them. But the stress itself is still there and the signs of stress get worse. At some point, they might even lead to the burnout syndrome.\nTherefore, it is very useful to learn for yourself which signs of stress you are experiencing. Knowing your personal symptoms already helps to prevent further stress and prevent letting it slip and get worse.\nAdditionally, by increasing your knowledge in this topic you might be able to identify such signs in your colleagues who might be eager to have someone understand what they are going through.\nIt is no sign of weakness to admit that you are stressed and need a break!\nTherefore, be honest with yourself.\nA non-stressed you is way more productive than a completely stressed-out you.\nKeep that in mind!\nAll the best!\nThe Mental Health Awareness Month post series is brought to you by Helmholtz Juniors\nWe thank Pedro Ivo Silva Batista (DESY), Martin Schrader (HZDR), Michaela Löffler (UFZ), Nicolas Stoll (AWI), Fabian Wolf (GEOMAR), Younes Bouhadjar (FZJ), Stephanie Taylor (DZNE), Khwab Sanghvi (DKFZ), Lukas Kreis (GSI), Johannes Nelles (UFZ), Vasundhra Shaw (DESY) and Olya Oppenheim (MDC) for the text and Marlene Härtel (HZB), Martin Schrader (HZDR), Anna-Lena Amend (HMGU) and Xin You (UFZ) for the design.\nFollow us and keep up2date with our work!\nhttps://www.helmholtz.de/karriere_talente/wissenschaft/promovierende/helmholtz_juniors/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/helmholtz.juniors/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/helmholtz.juniors/\nhttps://twitter.com/helmholtzjrs/\n","date":"2020-10-29T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2020/10/heju-mental-health-awareness-month-oct-2020-possible-stressors-and-signs-of-stress/images/Stressors_hu_392747788928a344.png","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2020/10/heju-mental-health-awareness-month-oct-2020-possible-stressors-and-signs-of-stress/","title":"HeJu Mental Health Awareness Month (Oct 2020) – Possible Stressors and Signs of Stress"},{"content":"This time the GFZ (German Research Centre for Geosciences) answers our 5 Questions.\nGerman Research Centre for Geosciences, by PR department (Send to us by Bernhard)\nHow would you describe your institute? The GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences is the national research centre for Earth sciences. Our research focuses on the geosphere within the highly complex System Earth with its further subsystems, its interacting subcycles, and its wide network of cause-and-effect chains.

Helmholtz association (HA) consists of 18 different research centers, conducting excellent research in variety of topics from cancer research to energy technology. This research would not be possible without the most talented and motivated scientists performing it. Therefore talent management and recruiting more gifted scientists is crucial for the association’s wellbeing. And to attract the best minds, one has to provide the best working conditions.\nAlmost half of the scientists of Helmholtz Association are doctoral researchers and significant part of studies are performed and published by them. Independent of the field of study, most of the doctoral researchers work de facto full time, dedicating their work and passion to science, notwithstanding that working- and contract conditions, as well as even monthly salary differ from center to center, sometimes even in precarious ways.\n(But) How come, that performing the same work we have different income? The main difference is coming from the fact, that not all of doctoral researcher have a working contract, but rather a stipend. Monthly income, social security, health insurance policy and amount of vacant days per year differ for doctoral researchers depending on center and contract situation. According to the Helmholtz Juniors’ survey 2014 and 2016, monthly net-income can differ up to 1.5 times between contract- and stipend-holders in different centers (900€ for stipends up to 2400€ for full 100% positions). Besides, not all researchers are paid till the completion (submission) of their PhD thesis. In some cases, they have to finish writing being de facto unemployed and unpaid, working towards their title without getting any income. It should be noticed that these stages of life, some doctoral researches already have family and children.\nBased on the survey data, former Helmholtz Juniors speakers Dagmara and Elias together with working conditions group formulated a statement urging Helmholtz association administration to equalize the working conditions for doctoral researchers. Among their demands were general rejecting of stipends, fixing contracts to a minimum of 65% of TVöD E13, increased amount of holidays and providing a contract for all the PhD time till submission. The statement we put together and sent to head of HA Otmar Wiestler as well as to the directors/Human resources of the individual Helmholtz Centers in fall 2016 and in winter 2016 to the state secretary Thomas Rachel from the BMBF.\nThe statements were thoroughly discussed during Helmholtz Association annual meeting and on 7th of December 2016 HeJu received an official answer to the statements with the comments for every requirement.\nThe burning question was if the stipends would be rejected in the Association. Unfortunately, Helmholtz association and BMBF do not see that the total abolishment of stipends is possible in the near future and refer to the guidelines of the Helmholtz association. Therefore, it is impossible to standardize the monthly income for all doctoral researchers. Generally, all the centres offering 65% TVöD E13 to contract-holders. However, the association can not influence the wage for stipend holders, especially if the stipend is not provided by Helmholtz itself.\nIncrease in amount of vacant days per year cannot be expected soon as well for legal reasons. According to federal law, doctoral researchers with grant agreement can not have the same amount of holidays as TVöD-employees (30 days).\nAs mentioned above, some of the topics were already addressed by the association while creating the ‘Guidelines for the completion of PhD projects within the Helmholtz Association’ issued in 2015. If you are a Doctoral researcher within Helmholtz Association and still have not seen the guidelines, contact your local HeJus or visit https://www.helmholtz.de/fileadmin/Guidelines-for-the-completion-of-PhD-projects-within-the-Helmholtz-Association.pdf.\nThe Guidelines address all aspects of PhD thesis completion, including the goals, the process itself, supervision, framework conditions and quality assurance. In particular, they recommend, that the promotion should be the main goal of PhD agreement and that ‘in consultation with the supervisory committee funding is to be sought until the submission of the dissertation to the university.’ Regulations of the supervision agreement and support to participate in graduate schools are also already a part of the Guidelines.\nSo, are all the issues already fixed with the Guidelines issued? One should keep in mind that unfortunately they are not written in stone and it is more of a recommendation than a real law, obliging to treat doctoral researchers in a certain way. Besides, almost every research center has it’s own guidelines concerning PhD completion.\nHowever the statements did initiate a change. Thus, Prof. Herzig, director of GEOMAR (Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research, Kiel), approved the statement and showed full support for Doctoral researchers. Working conditions for contract holders of the center had already fulfilled all the requirements of Helmholtz Juniors. Moved by the statement, administration of GEOMAR offered 75% FVöD contract to all internal stipend holders.\nWhat’s next? Are we done now?\nOf course, HeJu will not stop with this achievement. Representatives from GEOMAR were able initiate the change in their centre. Now it is up to HeJu in other 17 centres to make the administration aware of the statements and convince them, that improvement of working conditions is necessary and use the example of GEOMAR to prove that it’s possible.\nThe guidelines appeared in 2015, right after previous survey took place. With the survey 2017 we would like to evaluate whether or not they have brought a real change into doctoral researcher\u0026rsquo;s life and improved working conditions.\nWe are looking forward to the survey result and based on it we are going to identify the remaining issues and address them. The results are going to be presented to Prof. O. Wiestler and critically discussed to further improve working conditions.\nBesides, we are in dialog with the Federal Ministry of Education and Research raising the awareness of the problems.\nHopefully with all the effort we will achieve perfect and comparable working conditions for doctoral researchers in all the centers, which will not only improve our wellbeing, but also allow us to attract best minds from all over the world, pushing research of our centres to a new level of excellence and help us bringing back our focus to the thing we are here for - science.\n","date":"2017-10-24T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/10/contract-or-stipend-the-fight-for-doctoral-researchers-working-conditions-equality/images/Logo_for_web_hu_c4efcda05cd9b5f1.jpg","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/10/contract-or-stipend-the-fight-for-doctoral-researchers-working-conditions-equality/","title":"Contract or Stipend: the fight for Doctoral Researchers working-conditions equality"},{"content":" 1 Today we host a post from Tatyana Dubich, head of the Communication Team. When I started my PhD project, I saw just one way to go: get a PhD, go ahead as a postdoc with a goal to become professor one day. There was no other life after PhD I could imagine.\nAt that time a good friend of mine, a postdoc, confronted me with a statement, that based on the number of people who stay in academia 10 years after graduation, professorship is, in fact, an “alternative” career. I thought that he must be wrong. However, while I progressed with my studies I realized that my naive thinking indeed doesn’t pass the reality check.\nIt became clear that there are too many people with a doctorate degree and too few academic openings. In their study, Larson and colleagues applied populational approach and calculated a “birth rate” for PhD, which turned to be far too high. They concluded that only 12,8% of PhD graduates can attain academic positions in USA. More optimistic prognosis was published by Jordan Weissmann based on National Science Foundation\u0026rsquo;s data in 2013. Although amount of PhDs who found a job in academia vary as much as 5-45% depending on the field of study they averaged at 19,4%.Indeed, my postdoc friend was right. The studies show that the chances to get a tenured-tracked position are pretty grim.\nAccording to the recent study, conducted by Kahn and Ginther, about 80% of PhDs continue their studies as a postdoc, but only 21% of postdocs actually get a tenured-track positions ten years after PhD. Postdoc training is important for those who would like to pursue tenured-track position despite of all the odds. However, it might not be beneficial for those who chose a career outside academia. The study show that the postdocs who moved to industry, government or non-profit organization earn 17-21% less in 15 years, than their colleagues, who skipped postdoc stage and moved to working force directly after PhD. The data suggest that working experience is more valuable than post-doc training.\nIt means that you have to make your career choice early enough and plan your steps accordingly, rather then just go with the flow. Is professorship the only option? Clearly, not.\nHow do I make a choice?\nDuring the midterm meeting of the Helmholtz Juniors, Otmar Wiestler, the president of the helmholtz association, mentioned that, in order to find the best fit, one should take into account three major components - personal goal, passion and qualification. I was moved by the advice. Indeed, the formula seems to be rather straightforward: follow your dreams and do what you’re good at. But how do I know, if I my qualification is good enough to a specific job, if it will help me to achieve my personal goal or fulfill my passions? Those points aren’t usually a part of a job description. Science Careers developed a tool to help you measure your goals, passions and qualification and compare it with characteristics needed for specific careers, which I found extremely helpful. myIDP is designed specifically for users with doctoral degree in science and gives a set of non-academic careers one could pursue. It provides an extensive literature overview on every selected career path and gives you an idea, that are the possibilities, challenges and how to get started with one or another profession. It is a good way to get an idea for career development, if you can’t get a personal consultation.\nStepping out of the PhD-Postdoc dogma might be scary. It feels like the years in high school, university, graduate school prepared us for one ultimate goal - to become a professor. However, it is not true. PhD can be a starting step to variety of careers. Did you know, that there is a job called molecular animator? Yes, you need a PhD for that.\nI was inspired by TED-talk of Emilie Wapnick, which introduced me to the whole new concept - multipotentialites, as people with many interests and creative pursuits. Instead of fixing on one “true calling” for the whole life they keep exploring new areas and combine their various, sometimes opposite interests. It is all about goal-passion-qualification triangle again and making the best out of it. Are you sure science is your only passion? If not, why not to combine your interests into something bigger? One of the examples is Mayim Chaya Bialik, who is famous for her role as Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler in Big Bang Theory. Mayim has a PhD in neuroscience (for real!) and successfully combines her career as scientist, writer and actress. Another inspiring case is Dr. Randy Olson, who was a professor in marine biology before moving to Hollywood and becoming a filmmaker. His movies go further than just “educational films”: he introduces public to evolution, global warming, ocean pollution. He combines deep scientific knowledge with passion for moviemaking to arouse interest to such complex problems.\nSo, the options are limitless and go far beyond classical academia-industry dilemma. Every year more and more PhDs are moving for a job outside academia, even if PhD training prepares us for one career only - professorship. How do you become a successful science communicator, entrepreneur, patent agent or policy maker after such a training? You don’t. All of these careers require a PhD, but PhD only is not sufficient to be successful. Often additional training is required to become fit for one or another job. This realisation comes slowly and initiates a lot of discussion, so we might see some changes in the PhD training soon.\nHelmholtz Association works towards an implementation of career advice service as a part of PhD and PostDoc training. Career advice and alumni networks are already well established in some graduate schools and for some centers it is still a work in progress. Of course, a personal consultation would be the best solution, but finding a suitable candidate for the job might be a challenge.\nIt all sounds very promising, but I feel it is impossible to make one training program which includes all the needs of every career path possible. Therefore individual development plans are important and it is a good idea to make one as early as you can. This can be done either with a help of career advisor or maybe using something such as myIDP software. Learn as much as you can about different jobs requirements and plan courses you take accordingly. It might be difficult to squeeze them into packed experimental plan for your thesis, but it is totally worth it in a long run.\nSo yes, there is a life after PhD and it is far more diverse than I ever imagined. There are many options besides academia worth exploring and the road can take you anywhere! You just have to be prepared.\nReferences\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Larson RC, Ghaffarzadegan N., Xue Y., Too Many PhD Graduates or Too Few Academic Job Openings: The Basic Reproductive Number R0 in Academia.

But why did Maxwell then find it necessary to introduce the electric displacement in the form of the second term in (4)?\nMaxwell studied Faraday\u0026rsquo;s publications very carefully and he also recommended this to all physicists. - An old question was: „Why does a magnet attract a piece of soft iron in a certain distance according to Newton\u0026rsquo;s „actio = reactio“– law (5)? The well known experimental answer was: „The soft iron piece is transformed to become a magnet itself (6).“ Faraday now stated that the initial magnet impossibly could change properties of an object at a larger distance while ignoring all closer locations. And in fact if we put iron filings in between again all fluff individuals become small magnets arranging themselves along what then was still called force lines (7). The frenchman La Hire published this as early as in 1717. Faraday therefore started systematic experiments in order to try if the situation is analogous in electricity.\nA charged object polarizes an insulator at some distance (8). We call it „influence“, Faraday still named it „induction“. In order to study the role of space he therefore filled the gap between the two conductors of a spherical condenser with different insulating materials. The use of a „spherical“ arrangement eliminated disturbing border effects! All these „dielectrics“ altered the field in the gap in a well defined way(9). Therefore Faraday finally also tried what happens in vacuum – and really even in that case influence took place. Vacuum was electrically active too and obviously very much different from just „nothing“!\nBoth magnets and dipoles arranged as in the upper part of (10) were known to exhibit longitudinal attraction and transverse repulsion. Faraday generalized this to yield also for force lines themselves. That force lines tend to contract can be directly observed as the attraction between two charged metal plates of an plane condenser. But what about transverse repulsion? A local concentration of charges on condenser-plates as shown to the left in (10) is known not to be stable. Charge distribution will rather change to become uniform as in the right figure. We use to interprete this as a consquence of charge repulsion on conducting surfaces (or even more sophisticated as a consequence of equipotentials). Faraday, however, regarded it as a prime consequence of force lines transverse repulsion – and found the proof for this interpretation in the outbulging field at borders where no charges explicitely do exist!\nMaxwell read all this and finally realized that vacuum just should be regarded as a special kind of dielectrics. This means that materials due to their polarization always transform an electric field E into a „displacement field“ D = ε ε₀ E where the vacuum situation just is the particular case with ε = 1 (written in our modern nomenclature). A varying charge displacement in time therefore would behave just as any other electrical current. - This was the simple, bright and extremely successful idea!\nIn 1845 Faraday after many stressing efforts finally found the famous effect now bearing his name: The plane of linearly polarized light passing along the axis of a glass rod was rotated by a magnetic field originating from the electrical current through a coil around it. Maxwell considered what this does mean to magnetic force lines as such.\nWe must now take into consideration that physics in the 19th century still was dominated completely by mechanics. William Thomson, the late Lord Kelvin e. g. stated: „I never satisfy myself until I can make a mechanical model of a thing. If I can make a mechanical model, I can understand it. As long as I cannot make a mechanical model all the way through I cannot understand it.“ It was in this context that even Ludwig Boltzmann constructed a perfect mechanical model to demonstrate Faraday\u0026rsquo;s electromagnetic induction. (It still exists in the university of Graz, the author has seen it working!) So it takes no wonder that also Maxwell started on this path in 1861-1862.\nMaxwell thus began to regard the magnetic field as a conglomerate of flexible rotating, narrow tubes representing force lines (11). A rotating experimentally observed phenomenon might be transmitted only by field features rotating in screw form by themselves! He imagined the field strength not to be represented primarily by angular velocity but rather by the peripherical linear velocity of these tubes. An increasing radius of the tubes therefore would directly stand for Faraday\u0026rsquo;s transverse repulsion of the lines. The best corresponding mathematical model for all this existed in hydrodynamics at the time – and Maxwell was familiar with it, last not least because simultaneously his colleague Georges Stokes was active in Cambridge. Maxwell consequently tried to „translate“ hydrodynamics into a new language in order to find a coherent mathematical description for all electro-magnetic phenomena. Density for instance was replaced by permeability so that finally the „curling magnetic energy“ became proportional to the square of the field strength, and also a plausible form of Coulomb\u0026rsquo;s experimentally verified law was achieved. One very serious problem, however, still existed with this model: Friction between uniformly rotating tubes in direct contact (11)! The well known solution with e. g. cogwheels in contact is the introduction of a compensating idle between neighbors. In the case of the magnetic tubes a large number of small balls - very small spheres with hardly any mass - could achieve a similar result (12). And all these idles around magnetic tubes would finally represent electric materia! - Note, that the idea of electrons, not to speak about their spin then still was very far away in future! – Constant rotation of the field-tubes with all balls essentially keeping their position in space represented a permanent magnet. The surprising fact with the idea, however, is that a local drift of this „ballgas“ perpendicularly to the tubes could induce (additional) rotation and thus represent Oersted\u0026rsquo;s experiment - the reverse procedure with peripherically accelerating tubes on the other hand Faraday\u0026rsquo;s induction of an electric current.\nThis was the almost unbelievable start! - None of all these for us strange and somewhat crude ideas appear in Maxwell\u0026rsquo;s later publications, especially the famous „Treatise“ from 1865 any more. The mathematical formalism there became consistent by itself. It finally covered much more future Physics than Maxwell himself maybe ever realized!\u0026quot;\n","date":"2017-07-31T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/07/electric-displacement-and-maxwells-equations-why-and-how/images/electricity-voltage-light-energy-1_hu_2d3303de5ef4c624.jpg","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/07/electric-displacement-and-maxwells-equations-why-and-how/","title":"Electric Displacement and Maxwells Equations - Why and how?"},{"content":"To follow up our interview series, this month we would like to introduce you to the former and the current speakers of the Survey group, Danja and Bernhard. Danja worked on the establishment of the survey 2017, arranging the technical aspects since January 2016. Bernhard, the speaker of the 2017 survey group, had the task to run the survey and will lead the survey team through the analysis phase. Ultimately, the results of the survey will be made public and will be useful to get a coherent image of the status of the doctoral researchers among the Helmholtz Centers and to focus on the next steps we would like to take to improve our situation.\nThe Survey is of great importance for Helmholtz Juniors. Survey 2014 was the ground on which we based our request to have better and comparable contracts among the centers. You will read about this in a soon-coming blog.\nBut now, we would like to leave the word to Danja Sarink, from Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ) and Bernhard Schuck from GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ).\nQuestion: First, could you tell us a bit about your PhD project? Danja: I’m doing my PhD in cancer epidemiology, using a large European cohort study to analyze the relation between the Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor κβ-axis and breast cancer. My aims are mostly explorative: if and how these biomarkers relate to breast cancer in humans, but they could potentially be used to improve e.g. risk prediction or primary prevention of breast cancer.\nBernhard: Being a structural geologist, I focus on the Alpine Fault in New Zealand, which is the plate boundary between the Pacific and the Australian Plate. I aim to better understand what the rocks can tell us about the deformation mechanisms associated with large earthquakes.\nQ: We are all part of the Helmholtz association. What do you think is the value of being part of it? D: I think the network it creates. It gave me the opportunity to meet other doctoral researchers from different fields, as well as to get a broader idea of research and academia in Germany outside my institute.\nB: I agree with Danja. In addition, collaboration between individual centers representing a broad variety of research fields encourages us to think out of the box and to try new attempts to tackle scientific tasks.\nQ: How have you first learned about Helmholtz Juniors and why did you decide to join? D: I learned about HeJu when I joined one of the working groups of the PhD council at the DKFZ. What drew me to HeJu was the more overarching nature of and the fact that it aims to address bigger picture things, that can be difficult to address on your own or even within your institute. Q: You are part of the survey group, that is vital to the HeJu to gather information and decide future strategies. How would you define the work done by your group and what could be achieved with it? D: We work in a two year cycle; one group sets up and runs the survey, the next analyses the data and publishes results. We worked closely with Helmholtz headquarters on e.g. legal aspects of the survey. Most of our work is in the background, but over the last few months our main task was communication; we did our best to annoy all HeJus into advertising the survey at their centers, and Immo Korte at Helmholtz Headquarters has been great in helping us reach all the Helmholtz centers. As for future strategies, I think ‘gather information and decide future strategies’ captures the aims of the survey group well.\nB: The survey and its results are the essential base for any discussion between the HeJus and any institution within the Helmholtz Association. However, this important role required that the workflows within the group had to be professionalized. This is one of the greatest achievements of past year’s survey group under Danja’s leadership. Data handling and security follow the essential guidelines and templates are prepared so that the next group can minimize the effort to be invested in formal requirements and focus on the aspects they want to get out of the survey. A major achievement of the survey is that it is widely accepted as reference to set minimum standards for the working conditions of doctoral researchers at the individual centers.\nQ: Being a member of the survey group is a great responsibility and probably requires a good amount of your time. Why did you decide to join this group? D: It actually seemed like less work than the working conditions or events group! I knew I wanted to join either the communications or survey group and decided for the survey group because I get to use some of my epi/public health skills.\nB: In my case the decision was quite trivial. Benedikt, at that time the second HeJu from my center, was already part of the working conditions group. I don’t think communication is my strongest skill and the events group had already a fair number of members, I decided to join the smallest group: the survey group.\nQ: What are the biggest challenges you are facing or faced working in your group? B: Besides the need to meet all the formal requirements, one of the biggest challenges is to keep the group member’s motivation high. Running and evaluating the survey is a quite time-consuming task and the potential for frustration is high. Bearing in mind that all group members are volunteering the speaker has to ensure that group sticks to the schedule and still has some fun.\nD: I have to agree with Bernhard here that group-work can be fun and horribly frustrating at the same time, but I think we’ve also had a great core group of people in the survey group in both 2016 and 2017. For me, dealing with data protection and security issues was a learning curve. I knew it existed of course but I had never been directly involved with or responsible for them.\nQ: What do you think is the next challenge of the survey group or the HeJu in general? D: for the survey group, analyzing the data from this survey. We are also, for the first time, trying our hand at a time series analysis of some specific topics to see if there are any changes over time. For HeJu, a lot of work has been going on around working conditions and NextGen@Helmholtz, which I think is absolutely awesome! While running the survey (and also in setting up NextGen@Helmholtz I think) we noticed that not nearly all docs know what HeJu is or does. We exist to represent all docs, so I think this is a challenge to tackle.\nB: Whereas analyzing the data of the survey 2017 and to carry out the time series analysis are goals to be achieved in the next months, having a proper hand-over to the next survey group will be the final challenge for this group. It would be a fantastic turnout on the time invested by last year’s group members, if we manage to provide the next survey group with all the information necessary to focus on preparing the questionnaire, setting-up and running the next survey.\nQ: Recently, a lot of awareness rose on the correctness of data communication and on Science in general, culminating in the March for Science. What is your opinion on such manifestations and movements? D: The awareness and very public discussion on science is great. On the short term it’s relevant to scientists, but I think that in the long term it’s relevant to everyone that good unbiased science exists.\nB: My personal point of view is that these events are essential to communicate to society what science is about. A profound methodological base accepted by the scientific community is essential to achieve meaningful results. However, what these results tell us, how they should be interpreted and what consequences should arise, should and often is open to debate. There is no single expert to explain how the world works.\nQ: In your opinion, what is the major challenge scientists are facing in their relationship with society? B: Society invests tremendous amounts of money in science. Especially within the Helmholtz Association this money is often used to conduct fundamental research under fantastic working conditions. Scientists have to acknowledge that society has a right to get informed about their research in a way everyone is able to understand.\nD: I agree with Bernhard, he also makes a very good point in saying “…in a way everyone is able to understand”. Scientists are good at disseminating work to other scientists, but communication to the general public mostly happens through media. It would be great to see more focus on science communication in a broader form than manuscripts, conferences, and press releases.\nQ: Coming to a conclusion, we would like to know what you would like to say to someone interested in joining the Helmholtz Juniors. Should they? D: Definitely! There is work involved of course but, if you’re interested, it’s also rewarding and the different working groups give you the chance to develop very different skills.\nB: Absolutely. As doctoral researchers our training is closely related to the research we conduct, be it in the lab or when it comes to presenting the results in conferences and papers. Joining the HeJus encourages you to develop a number of soft skills like time and conflict management but also to see what and how things are done in different disciplines.\nQ: As a last question, would you like to share your favourite moment in the HeJu and explain why it was important for you? D: I think HeJu has had a few fantastic achievements over the last year, with our letter about working conditions to the Helmholtz board and BMBF (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung) and our first NextGen@Helmholtz conference. I will have to go a bit smaller though; my highlight was running the survey. We invested a lot of time and had to jump some unexpected hurdles on the way, so it was very satisfying to see the live result!\nB: The first NextGen@Helmholtz at HZI (Helmholtz-Zentrum für Infektionsforschung) last year in Braunschweig with doctoral researchers from all over the country coming together and presenting what they do was a fantastic experience. But I agree with Danja, running the survey was my favorite moment, too. We spent so much time during the last year on all the preparation and had a rough time trying to finish the survey this February. Seeing that the survey was finally running and that the number of participants was constantly increasing was amazing.\n","date":"2017-07-12T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/07/meet-bernhard-and-danja-of-our-survey-group/images/LOGO_Blue2_hu_9d5b6c02b5703be9.png","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/07/meet-bernhard-and-danja-of-our-survey-group/","title":"Meet Bernhard and Danja, of our survey group"},{"content":"Same time of year, different Helmholtz center!\nAt the beginning of the year, in February, the Helmholtz Juniors annual meeting took place in the beautiful Heidelberg, where the old city and the state-of-the-art cancer research facilities of the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) meet! Thirty-four representatives from all Helmholtz centers joined the 3-days meeting. We were fortunate that the spokespersons of Max Planck PhDnet and Leibniz PhD Network joined us.\nThe DKFZ was very hospitable. During the meeting, the graduate program director, Dr. Lindsay Murrells, introduced the research at DKFZ and its graduate school to us. On the DKFZ campus, there are 3,000 personnel working on cancer research, 540 of which are doctoral researchers. She also introduced us to the various services that the career center provides for both doctoral researchers and Postdocs.\nWe had a very special tour in two of the most modern facilities for cancer research and treatment in Europe, the High-Field Whole Body MR (7 Tesla) and the Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Facility (HIT). Thanks to the arrangements of DKFZ HeJus, Danja and Elias, we also enjoyed our time in the old town of Heidelberg. Photo credits go to Elias.\nWhat we achieved in 2016:\nAt the beginning of the meeting, Dagmara, HeJus Spokesperson in 2015/16, pointed out that one of the HeJus\u0026rsquo; goal is to improve doctoral researchers\u0026rsquo; working conditions, yet the occasion to hear them out are limited to the survey and the NextGen conference. She said, \u0026ldquo;If we cannot hear from them, we cannot help them.\u0026rdquo; What we achieved and plan to achieve clearly reflect this goal.\nThe HeJus are organized into 4 working groups: working conditions, survey, communications, and events. On the first day, the speakers of each group reported on what their groups have accomplished in 2016. No surprise there, the achievements were astonishing! The events group reported on NextGen 2016, the first German-wide meeting of Helmholtz doctoral researchers. We also met members of the dedicated team of talented PhD students at GEOMAR, Kiel organizing NextGen. The group also gave us a glimpse of then preliminary program of NextGen@Helmholtz 2017 in Kiel.\nThe working conditions group has worked with all HeJus for years on the most optimal working conditions statement: \u0026ldquo;65% TVöD E13 payment, 30 days of vacation, and a contract of minimum 3 years from the beginning with the doctoral project as the main job objective.\u0026rdquo; The working conditions group sent their statement to Prof. Dr. Otmar D. Wiestler, the President of the Helmholtz Association. Prof. Wiestler kindly offered his time to respond to the statement (we will publish his response in a following blog post). All HeJus has sent the statement to their respective directors, and Lisa, the HeJu from GEOMAR, has shared with us a remarkable success story. GEOMAR Dokteam has met with the Director, Prof. Peter Herzig, concerning the statement, and within 1 month GEOMAR changed the status of 13 in-house and Max Planck stipend holders into 75% TVöD contracts.\nAs part of the largest research association in Germany, and believing that science is not isolated from the political and societal scenes, the working conditions group also prepared a questionnaire and sent it to the main German political parties about their views on scientific research. The HeJus are awaiting for the answers which will be publicly available to guide the German voters prior to the elections in September, 2017.\nThe efforts of HeJus spokespersons in 2015/16 Dagmara and Elias have secured the HeJus a budget of 50,000 EUR per year for 3 years. The spokespersons are the contact point and external representation of the HeJus. They communicate regularly with other PhD networks and with the Helmholtz Association. We now have a direct contact at the headquarters to Dr. Johannes Freudenreich, who is known for his efforts promoting of young and early researchers with focus on postdocs, supervisors training and the newly formed international research schools.\nThe survey group shared with us the news that they have finished preparing the 2017 survey. The available budged allowed them to run the survey on a secure platform. The survey covered many issues that are integral to the doctoral researchers such as: funding, supervision, graduate schools, working conditions, career plans, and infrastructure.\nAnd finally, all the updates, news, events and outreach have been brought to you by the communications group! We communicate the HeJus news to you through our various channels: the blog, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn . We report on the various events that HeJus take part in. We also outreach for new HeJu members and introduce HeJus working groups to them.\nWhat we will achieve in 2017:\nOn the second day, we went on preparing our plan for 2017. The highlights are:\nNetwork of Networks (N^2): The HeJus, Max Planck PhDnet and Leibniz PhD Network have been in close contact and exchange of experiences since the beginning of each of them. Now they formed N^2, a network for all doctoral researchers at all non-university research organizations in Germany. The first participation of N^2 was at the March For Science. N^2 plans joint events and call for interested doctoral researchers to participate in it. Stay tuned to know more about N^2 formation and activities here on the blog soon.\nNextGen@Helmholtz at GEOMAR: NextGen is very special because it is an exclusive event of Helmholtz Association doctoral researchers. It has a unique nature as a multidisciplinary meeting. Its program includes a certificate-based science communication training. The alumni session is meant to provide the now students with various ideas of what is after-PhD. Through NextGen, we know about facilities at other Helmholtz Centers for perhaps future collaborations. Because of that all, the Hejus communicated to the graduate schools at all the centers to provide financial support and credit points for their doctoral researchers registering for NextGen.\nThe Speakers:\nWith their enthusiasm and expertise, we elected Giulia and Konstantin as the HeJus spokespersons for the year 2017. Giulia Caglio [Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC), Berlin] has been a member of the HeJus communications group. You certainly read her blog posts here. In the DokTeam, Giulia was proactive and had a sense of responsibility to improve the working conditions at her institute. She plans to pursue the same as a spokesperson of the HeJus. Konstantin Kuhne [Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR), Dresden] was the HeJus treasurer for the past year. He gained an overview on the organization within the Helmholtz Association. We will hear from them here on the blog, and from the newly elected treasuress Lara Grünig from the Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht Centre for Materials and Coastal Research (HZG).\nBut what does that meeting mean for \u0026ldquo;non-HeJus\u0026rdquo;? We have a few recommendations in that regard!\nNow officially in all HeJus documentations and communications we are all called “Doctoral Researchers”! A term that precisely describes our day-to-day job at the largest research association in Germany, and empowers us to achieve it.\nThe doctoral researchers are 50% of the working force at the Helmholtz Association and a significant fraction of the scientific output and publications is produced by doctoral researchers. The working conditions and survey groups need your input from all the centers and to react upon it to improve the contracts and working conditions of the students.\nStay tuned for a series of interviews and interesting research project from all the Helmholtz centers here on the blog!\nAsk the HeJu representatives of your center and your graduate school for our \u0026ldquo;Why to become a HeJu?\u0026rdquo; flyer. Consider becoming the HeJu representative of your center in the next elections.\nGet involved! If you missed NextGen 2017 registration, like us and be ready for N^2 events and NextGen 2018!\n","date":"2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/06/helmholtz-juniors-annual-meeting-2017-hejus-achievements-and-plan/images/csm_group_photo_2017_web_cbdc94603d_hu_91914dc5228985a1.jpg","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/06/helmholtz-juniors-annual-meeting-2017-hejus-achievements-and-plan/","title":"Helmholtz Juniors Annual Meeting 2017: HeJus Achievements and Plan"},{"content":"Today we have a second guest post by Tatyana Dubich, the Speaker of the Helmholtz Juniors Communication Group and a doctoral researcher at The Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (HZI). Enjoy the interviews with the participants of the March for Science!\n\u0026ldquo;March for Science, not march of scientists\u0026rdquo;\nAmong all the things said and published every day, it might be hard to tell where the truth is: astrology or astronomy, creationism or evolutionism, homeopathy or medicine. The answer, however, is simple: the one, which has real evidence! On Saturday, the 22nd of April, people all over the world joined the March for Science to state it once again. People, who believe in science, joined marches in more than 600 cities worldwide including Germany to demonstrate importance of free, unbiased, evidence-based science.\nThe March for Science was supported by Alliance of Science Organisations in Germany, which includes the Helmholtz Association. In its official statement, the Alliance says that “anti-democratic and anti-scientific actions and currents, led by political decision-makers or populist movements, threaten the work and the values of the sciences and all those who work in it”. The statement also advocated the importance of freedom in research and teaching. At the centers level, Prof. Dr. Karin Lochte, Director of Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), said in her statement that “science thrives on the freedom of opinion, on tolerance and international exchange, and on the shared goal of understanding the world we live in and using peaceful means to make it just a bit better every single day”, and motivated everyone to fight for the freedom in research as both scientists and citizens.\n\\[gallery type=\"slideshow\" size=\"full\" ids=\"380,382,383\"\\]Despite the caprice April weather, people who support science marched along the main streets of their cities, carrying wonderful homemade banners. “Science, not silence” was written on many of them. Helmholtz Juniors joined the marches in Berlin, Hamburg, Heidelberg, Munich, Dresden and Göttingen, and they motivated all the doctoral researches within the Helmholtz Association to join. We marched in a friendly crowd as N^2 - the newly formed network between Helmholtz Juniors, Max Plank PhDnet and Leibniz PhD Network. We carried the N^2 logo and our slogans, urging to “make the Earth cool again” and pointing out that “we are p\u0026lt;0.05”!\n\\[gallery type=\"slideshow\" size=\"full\" link=\"file\" ids=\"402,406,398,389\"\\]In Berlin, Heidelberg and Munich marches were accompanied by speeches from academics of different levels (from students to institutes\u0026rsquo; directors), policymakers and science communicators. The talks pointed at the importance of evidence-based decision making for further development; why it is crucial to support free, unbiased, evidence-based science. After all, science shapes almost every aspects of our everyday life and it is the key to progress.\n\\[gallery type=\"slideshow\" link=\"file\" size=\"full\" ids=\"392,399,409,404,403,401,407,405\"\\]HeJu Communication Team asked the march participants in Berlin, Heidelberg and Munich: why did they march for Science? Most of them joined to show that they believe in fact-based thinking in contrast to recent trends of emotion-based thinking, that is leading to decreased number of vaccinations, climate-change denial, and the use of \u0026ldquo;alternative facts\u0026rdquo; in politics, to name a few.\nHere are some of the interviewed comments:\n“After all what happened in the last years in America and Europe it is important to show the world that there are people who believe in science and don’t want to believe in alternative facts, like all the movements against vaccination, evolution and those kind of things. Because what happens in science is the truth and we have much more evidence. With a march like this we can convince people to believe in facts.”\n“I hope, that events like this will make a difference. I cannot hope to make the difference alone, but rather a part of a big scientific community. We, as a community, should show that we are against cutting the budget for research, which has a major impact on our future. I think it is very important to address this topics and make people think about it.”\n“I march for science because I believe, that we should stay together and remember, that we are not in the Middle ages anymore. Therefore, we should support scientists to explore our world for further development”\n“The decisions should be made based on evidence, not on feelings. We came here to stress that.”\n“I think it is important that we stand up for the integrity of science and openness. It is important that scientist can do their research without restrictions by government or people, driven by feelings”\n“I came here to stress the importance of science without politic. Science should be free from political influence”\nAll of the participants had different reasons, but one common goal - to underline the importance of staying rational and objective rather than following feelings. And we all hope that the March for Science will make a difference. But the march was just the beginning. We should keep the momentum and advocate good science. Communicating science, making it seen and heard should be our everyday goal and not a one-off deal.\nJoin the movement!\n","date":"2017-05-08T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/05/helmholtz-juniors-and-n2-at-the-march-for-science/images/Berlin_hu_9cdd0ea2eb6cae6a.jpeg","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/05/helmholtz-juniors-and-n2-at-the-march-for-science/","title":"Helmholtz Juniors and N^2 at the March for Science"},{"content":"Today we host a post by Tatyana Dubich, Speaker of the Helmholtz Juniors Communication Group. Enjoy the reading! Have you ever tried to explain your PhD project to your Grandma? Than you know already delivering complex ideas could be a real hassle!\nOn the 30th of March nine young scientists showed us how it’s done during the preliminary FameLab competition at the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research (HZI) (https://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/en/). The participants gave us a glimpse into a variety of projects, from autoimmunity to aviation, convincing the audience that their scientific projects are the most exciting of all.\nSeven different institutions were represented on the science communication competition. Among them were HZI, Twincore, Technische Universität Braunschweig, the Medical School Hannover, the Leibniz Universität Hannover, the Max-Planck-Institut für Eisenforschung and Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht.\nThe event started with warm welcome words of Prof. Dirk Heinz, the scientific director of HZI. Prof. Heinz introduced the members of the jury and participants, and in his speech he underlined the importance of science communication on every step of a research career. However, I believe, the importance of science communication is far beyond just one’s scientific career.\nResearch gets more and more complex and it is important to deliver it to public in an engaging, but also clear and accurate way. And that’s what FameLab is all about! The three whales for winning the competition are content, clarity and charisma. The rules are simple: participants have to explain their projects in less than a three minutes, being within one square meter space on stage just with the use of objects they can carry!\nThis year\u0026rsquo;s jury consisted of four members: Johannes Kaufmann (editor of Braunschweigischer Zeitung), Prof. Dr. Michael Steinert (TU Braunschweig, Infection Biology), Claudia Gorille (Journalist) and Axel Richter (Braunschweigische Stiftung). The jury were to choose the best presentation based on best didactics, scientific context, body language and the most convincing line.\nThe competition was extremely tough. Every short presentation carried the audience into excitement and challenges of the field. Even the most experienced critics could not predict the winner. The competition kept the tension on till the very end. I have to say, it was a real nailbiter!\nYet, the first prize was snatched by Panagiota Mamareli from the TWINCORE for her presentation on “The role of intracellular fatty acid metabolism on intestinal immune responses”.\nThe second prize went to Aniruddha Dutta from the Max-Planck-Institut für Eisenforschung. He showed a complex matter of steel improvement using just an ordinary Oreo cookie! The audience also got to make their own champion.\nNicola Ganter, from the Technische Universität Braunschweig won the audience prize. The winners of this round of FameLab will get a money price together with a media training from the best coaches in science communication. Furthermore they will take part in the German final in Bielefeld.\nAfter every presentation, the jury gave feedback to the participants to help them improve their presentation. I believe, that those advises would be useful not only to the participants, but also to every presenter. So, here is what we learned:\nPassion and confidence are the key for a successful presentation: only an inspired scientist can get a listener excited about his/her project and gain the attention. If you don’t believe yourself, that your project is the coolest one, how are you going to convince the audience? Find a healthy balance between complex ideas and didactic: think of a most clear and comprehensive metaphors. Just, don’t go too far! Every thing you tell to the audience has to be correct! For example, it might seem as a good idea to compare a reproducible experiment with a unicorn, but don’t go over the rainbow! In your story telling the scientific context and its future perspective is important. Tell your audience what motivated you to do your project and how it can bring us to a brighter future. Take-home message is key! Use your voice. Speak loudly and confidently; don’t be afraid to use the whole range of your voice and change the tempo. Go fast, slow down, pause to make concepts sink in. Even the most exciting lines of your talk will go unnoticed if you keep robotic tone through the whole talk. Use your body. Move towards your audience when you want to highlight your point and go back in between. Body language is engaging: don’t stand still. People are not used to listen to a talking monument and most probably won’t take it seriously. Grab their attention from the beginning: use jokes to make them laugh or a statistics to scare them. For example, did you know that doctoral researchers have two times higher chance to get crazy than the general population? True story! Involve the audience into your presentation. Ask them questions and make them choose between different solutions. Surprise them and keep them awake. More: react to the conditions! Is it hot in the auditorium? How can your invention impact this problem? Communicate not only the idea, but the scientific process as well. A broad audience doesn’t necessary know how the experiments go or how failure and “Eureka!” moments go hand in hand in research. Give the audience some insights: let them follow the process. There is a law in theater: “One must not put a loaded rifle on the stage if no one is thinking of firing it”. The same rule applies here. Use all the props you brought with you on stage, or don’t bring them at all. If you come to the stage wearing mouse ears and a tail, everyone will be waiting for an of what they are for. There is no science without science communication: we all have to communicate our ideas, independent of the field of study. Science communications is not only communication of science to the public, but it is also communication with fellow scientists and future collaborators, experts in our field or not. So I believe, that those advices I shared with you would be helpful to your everyday life as well. Every year FameLab brings together the best science communicators, we can get inspired and learn from.

Elias comes from DKFZ in Heidelberg, Dagmara from GEOMAR in Kiel and they are spokespersons since February 2016, when they were elected during the annual meeting of the Helmholtz Junior. They were asked some questions about their work, duty and ideas about doctoral researchers and HeJus.\nWe hope you will enjoy the reading as we did the writing!\nThe interview was edited for brevity and clarity.\nQuestion: Would you like to briefly tell us what are you working on in your graduate research? Dagmara: As a doctoral researcher I work at GEOMAR, the Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel. My research is focused on trace metal chemistry in seawater. Trace metals are biologically vital micronutrients to all marine organisms. The ultimate aim of my project is to quantify fluxes of these essential nutrients from the coastal waters to the open ocean.\nElias: I’m interested on molecules that are regulating the intrinsic properties of blood stem cells. For me, they are quite an interesting bunch. They are full of regeneration and differentiation potential, but they are mostly sitting around doing nothing, only working when they are really forced to do so. However, those principally “lazy” stem cells are capable of replenishing a whole organ, the blood system, when they are called for their job.\nQ: When have you decided to join the HeJus and how you got to know the association? D: I became a PhD representative at GEOMAR and through that, I was informed about HeJu activities; it sounded very interesting and I decided to join the Helmholtz Juniors in February after the election to institutional PhD representation.\nE: It’s quite a straightforward story: both at the University Heidelberg and within my Helmholtz Center, the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) I was already engaged in the representation of doctoral researchers, and by this I also got to know previous HeJu members and the network itself. I was quite curious about the interdisciplinarity of the group and the direct exchange between researchers from different fields of science.\nQ: You were elected spokesperson, how is it? D: Being a spokesperson is a lot of responsibility and at times a lot of work along with my PhD project. However, I enjoy working with a vast group of highly motivated and enthusiastic people across so many disciplines. There are so many different points of views and approaches and it’s a great opportunity to learn from others. It has been a great experience.\nE: Fascinating, absolutely! To some people, the position might seem to involve only a lot of tedious discussions and email-writing, without any visible progress. Sometimes that is in part true, but hey! in every “job” there are those days. I’ve really learned so much during this year about communication, science management and, in fact, quite a bit about myself. I think especially by attending big official meetings and by being forced to think more about larger structures and programs rather than specific little problems, one gets a better idea what this sometimes overused “big picture” phrase actually means. Seeing so many bright people working jointly to move something forward and getting all the loose ends of little projects together: it is just very rewarding in the end.\nQ: Which responsibilities do you have and how your work inside the HeJus changed? D: My work didn’t change as I became a spokesperson as soon as I became HeJu ;-)\nE: Together with my co-speaker, Dagmara, we’re trying to coordinate all the different topics within Helmholtz Juniors and to enable everyone to achieve our goals efficiently – in the end, everyone at HeJus is a volunteer, and thus we’re also mainly making sure to get rid of obstacles on their way. A big part of this year was spent strengthening the bonds with other research associations. Also, as the face of the HeJu towards the public, we’re the first contact point to journalists and political parties. Apart from that additional duties, my efforts in the working condition group has not changed: I’m still very active in this field.\nQ: Do you think the work of HeJus can contribute to ameliorate the doctoral researchers conditions inside Helmholtz Institutes? D: Of Course it can!\nE: Yes, definitely! I think we’re on a good way there. It’s for sure not going to happen overnight, though, and we need more input and feedback from doctoral researchers at the institutions, most importantly via our survey happening in the beginning of 2017. I think we made it quite clear in the discussions with the responsible officials that we are the scientific future of the centers – and not just some cheap labor without a voice. Q: Do you think the HeJus could be an example for other researcher in other institution inside and outside Germany? E: Another strong yes here. To my experience, it is very difficult to reach and mobilize doctoral researchers. So many people are complaining about their working conditions or their supervision, but in order change something we must team up! This part of our scientific career is the one phase where you basically should be as free as possible to realize your own ideas, but realistically seen, it is the time of highest dependency for most doctoral researchers. The things we do within Helmholtz also can help to motivate researchers to look beyond their everyday field of work, maybe encouraging to share ideas of science with the public.\nQ: What are in your opinion the biggest challenges a doctoral researcher has to face in his 3-5 years at the Helmholtz Institutes? D: The most common problems that have been revealed across the Helmholtz Association were: lack or poor supervision, depression, unclear contracts, unknown future. Of course all these problems and their magnitude and relevance differ between centers.\nE: For the “usual” researcher the most common challenge is simply how to finish the thesis project within the given timeframe, though that is barely worth noticing. That being said, all the other problems arising are often structural, i.e. insufficient funding or problems between supervisors and collaborators or even the classical clash between the professor and their doctoral researchers, due to missed chances for communication. It’s these issues that doctoral researcher representatives like the HeJus can make a difference in. Q: How could HeJus help and contribute to solve and overcome these challenges? D: As a Helmholtz Association PhD representation, we always try to work towards the improvement of the doctoral Researchers working conditions. Currently, we’re working on improving the contract situation across the Helmholtz Association. We want all doctoral researchers to feel secure and appreciated at all Helmholtz centers. Also, we’re in contact with Helmholtz Graduate Centre coordinators that have structures and closer connection with the doctoral researchers at the respective centres.\nE: In my opinion, the strong dependency of doctoral researchers that I mentioned before is the reasons why Helmholtz Juniors are so important. As a joint network, we can focus much more on general structural problems and on how to solve them, than a single doctoral researcher or even local representatives could. Sure, I could always personally ask for a rise of my salary and be successful, but setting new standards in the field requires to bring forces together. A main strength of HeJu is the sharing of information – problems of doctoral researchers at one center might already have been solved at another. It is much easier to argue with officials about topics of concern for doctoral researchers when you can toss in information and experience from colleagues at completely different institutes. It worked pretty often in the last year. Q: What are the priorities the HeJus are currently working on? D: Working conditions improvement, in particular of stipend holders. At the moment we are proposing an improved version of contracts that should be implemented across all 18 Helmholtz Centres. Also, the survey that is planned to be released soon, in the first months of 2017. This will give us an insight into working conditions situation across all Helmholtz Centres and supervision satisfaction amongst all doctoral researchers\nE: The top priorities are the survey, working conditions improvment and making the NextGen@Helmholtz 2017 in Kiel (Conference with doctoral researchers of all the Helmholtz centers) happen, in no particular order. There might be some novelties regarding joint projects with PhDNet and the Leibniz representation later this year. Stay tuned for more info on Facebook or Twitter @HelmholtzJrs!\nQ: What do you think of the raise of the awareness on PhD frustration/depression science-wide, as well as the long working hours outside contracts (for an example see here)? E: The whole topic is slowly getting into the attention of media and the science community, which I think is superb, but as long as the “Old skool” Professors just regard this as weakness of a younger generation - À la: “In my PhD I did not even have time to count my working hours, let alone thing about holidays” - little will change. Perhaps, with such a high number of people considering quitting, one might wonder whether there really is a need for everyone to go through doing a PhD project (as it is still required for many jobs in Germany) or if a smaller number of well-connected and optimally supported researchers would be much more efficient. In the end, it’s a job that involves a lot of creativity and I am not sure if being forced to do more than 50 hours a week can really be kept throughout a whole career, without damaging motivation and efficiency.\nQ: How do you think we could improve the situation in the Helmholtz Centers, if it is needed? E: I think we really must get rid of the old thinking of doctoral researchers doing work only for themselves and their education and shift the attention to the impact that our research has. We are working on proper scientific questions, we produce scientific output and by this we promote our Helmholtz Centers and science in Germany. It should be only natural to provide the best support for these highly-specialized workers, if we want to have the best institutions in the respective fields of study. And I think Helmholtz should have those aims for their centers.\nQ: Lastly, being a spokesperson, or HeJu, could be perceived as a lot of responsibility and work. Would you tell us the reason why you like it and dedicate your time and why, in your opinion, would be nice for other researcher to join the HeJus? D: Helmholtz Juniors positions are open for all enthusiastic volunteers researchers across Helmholtz Associated centres that are willing to work towards the improvement of PhD working conditions in general. We are welcoming anyone that has a need and drive to work for the PhD life improvement as a Helmholtz Junior.\nE: I am a spokesperson because, by doing this, I have the unique possibility to work with independent, young and skilful researchers on topics completely unrelated with our usual field of science. It is, basically, science seen from a different angle. I learned a great deal within this time and I am sure that I will be able to use these skills I have acquired through my whole life, though “doing the job” seems tiresome at times. We learn a lot doing our PhD anyways, but these extra lessons are worthwhile to be taken. It’s simply an incredibly stimulating way to spend your time and do something useful. You have my definite recommendation for anyone to join the Helmholtz Juniors! You won’t regret it.\n","date":"2017-02-15T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/02/meet-dagmara-and-elias-our-spokespersons/images/DSC_7670_web_hu_40f9fb0704a6d625.gif","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/02/meet-dagmara-and-elias-our-spokespersons/","title":"Meet Dagmara and Elias, our spokespersons"},{"content":"Today, we have a special guest post by Danja Sarink, PhD Candidate at the Division of Cancer Epidemiology, The German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ). Danja is also the spokesperson of the Survey Group of the HeJus. Now I leave you with a brilliant inside look at NextGen 2016!\nOn 28-30 September Helmholtz Juniors hosted the very first NextGen@Helmholtz conference. Nearly 120 doctoral researchers from all Helmholtz centers joined us for action-packed: three days of networking, presenting and learning, at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research in Braunschweig.\nFor an impression of the conference have a look!\nWhat did we do?\nTo start the conference and to introduce all 18 Helmholtz Centers participants presented their institute in one minute. We got a fantastic overview of the huge diversity of research going on in the Helmholtz Association – and the creativity of PhD students! Who knew that umbrellas make excellent jellyfish? And that maybe, next time, we should take into account when Oktoberfest happens!\nOne of the main focus points of NextGen was multidisciplinary and we challenged participants to explain their work to doctoral researchers from different fields; 83 participants presented their research in three poster sessions. There was naturally a lot of discussion between researchers from similar fields, but the amount of crosstalk – physicists explaining their work to sociologists, engineers asking about the work of geologists, and so on – was amazing to see!\nLisa Bittner (Influence of pH on the toxicity of pharmaceuticals in zebrafish embryos, UFZ), Mia Rudolph (Serial Protein Crystallography in Living Cells, DESY) and Uli Einhaus (ROPPERI-A TPC readout with Timepix and pads, DESY) did an especially great job explaining their work, and received the poster awards. Congratulations!\nSix truly brave doctoral researchers participated in the NextGen Science Slam, and we saw some really innovative takes on science – appealing to participants’ empathy, sense of humor and sense of rhythm. We have to give a honorable mention the impressive rap from UFZ’s very own McBiogas (Fabian Bonk), but the audience awarded the best science slam to Daniel Meza Arredondo from HZB, who talked about mom, Pesos and a chocolate vending machine on Mexikoplatz in Berlin, which was an excellent analogy for his work on solar cells. Congratulations!\nSo, at this point, everyone at NextGen knew all about the Helmholtz Association and how to present their doctoral work – but what comes after? The classical path of doctorate-postdoc-professor is of course not nearly the only option for a doctoral researcher and the alumni session offered the opportunity for participants to talk to Helmholtz alumni about their career paths. The 12 alumni who joined were all at different stages in their careers – anywhere between postdoc and retired – and some had taken surprising career paths to get to their current jobs in various sectors, ranging from academia to science communication, to technology and product management in industry, to entrepreneurship and politics. The round tables were swamped and alumni spoke to participants to the absolute end of the session and, for those who could stay, even after the session ended.\nThe alumni session was followed (after an amazing lunch) by a multidisciplinary workshop, where carefully randomized teams of doctoral researchers from all Helmholtz centers were put on the spot: how could humanity travel to and survive on Mars? Every team was required to include all their members fields in their mission plan, but we kept other parameters for this task deliberately vague (will earth still be there to go back to? Will space travel exist?). Seven teams presented very varied takes and some very convincing reasoning on this challenge – a focus on the journey to Mars versus what to do on Mars, keeping the space craft operational versus using it for resources, living above ground versus living below, relying on trade versus Mars’ own resources. One of the most important tools for success is of course using the skills of everyone involved, and proposals were judged as such by Dr. Rebecca Ludwig, project manager with the cross-disciplinary ENLIGHT-TEN program. For missions this big, there can only be one winning proposal – Congratulations to the ingenious crew of M.Pathfinder!\nLast but not least, NextGen hosted an expert panel on the topic of “publish or perish”. Prof. Wiestler (President of the Helmholtz Association), Prof. Alexander Lerchl (Jacobs University Bremen), Prof. Mark Brönstrup (HZI Braunschweig), and Prof. Bettina Eick (TU Braunschweig). It was a great experience to listen to professionals talking about the broad topic, its influence on their fields of research, and how it relates to doctoral researchers.\nWhat did we do well?\nTwo thirds of the participants completed our exit-survey, and results were overwhelmingly positive! Nearly all participants rated NextGen@Helmholtz as very good (62%) or good (34%), and a stunning 88% would recommend it to others. The science slam (68% very good; 21% good) and alumni sessions (49% very good; 35% good) were rated as highlights of the program. Opinions on the poster session, multidisciplinary workshop, and expert panel were a bit more divided – though they were still rated as good or very good by at least half of the participants. The time available for and facilitation of networking (social activities, workshops, etc) during the conference were also well received.\nThere are always things that could have gone better, and that we will of course aim to improve! The two points participants liked least were the venue for the poster session (5% very poor; 19% poor) and the time available for the multidisciplinary workshops (7% very poor; 24% poor[1]).\nA big “thank you!” to…\nWe would like to extend a big “Thank you!” to the Helmholtz Association for making it possible for us to organize NextGen@Helmholtz, the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (HZI) in Braunschweig for hosting us, and to all speakers and participants for making it a success!\nWhat’s next for NextGen?\nWe hope NextGen@Helmholtz will continue to provide an informal and low pressure environment for doctoral researchers to talk and gain ideas about their science and their PhD (and beyond), and to try new approaches to presenting their work, both regarding new formats and people from completely unrelated fields.\nKeep an eye out for NextGen@Helmholtz 2017 at the Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research (GEOMAR) in Kiel!\n[1] Excluding 33 participants (42%) who did not answer this question\n","date":"2016-11-10T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2016/11/nextgen-2016-more-than-a-conference/","title":"NextGen 2016: More than a Conference!"},{"content":"28th of September is approaching fast and it is going to be the first PhD retreat of all the Helmholtz institutes, organised by the Helmholtz Juniors (link to web page). Three days in Braunschweig for a multidisciplinary meeting that will involve 127 Doctoral Researchers and guests. Prof. Wiesler, President of the Helmholtz association, who believes on the importance of promoting the connection between Helmholtz institutes, will join for the expert panel talks, targeting the “Publish or Perish” philosophy in academia.\nThe 3 days will give the researcher the possibility to network and learn about other institutes and peers research, present their work, as well as meet with Alumni to discuss future opportunities after the PhD.\nAs the slogan says, this is a conference organised by PhDs for PhDs and it has as main focus bringing together experts in different disciplines to foster ideas and discussions outside their field. The world is moving to a multidisciplinary approach everyday more, and the Helmholtz institutes offer a variety of expertise that could collaborate together. In this direction goes the challenge of the multidisciplinary workshop that will see different teams compete to plan the best way to colonize Mars - future is never too far! Additionally, science slam will offer an opportunity to practice communication skills, also in an unconventional way - dancing, acting, talking, everything is welcome!\nWe, as Helmholtz Juniors, are excited for this great opportunity and grateful for the immense work the event group put to make these 3 days unforgettable for all the participants.\nWe hope you will like it and it will become the event the doctoral research will look forward in all the Helmholtz centers.\nSee you there!\n","date":"2016-09-21T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2016/09/1st-nextgen-meeting-is-coming-soon/images/Logo_NextGen_4c_kl_hu_778298f749b290bb.png","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2016/09/1st-nextgen-meeting-is-coming-soon/","title":"1st NextGen meeting is coming soon"},{"content":"On July 13, the Helmholtz Juniors (you may know as HeJus) conducted their meeting in Berlin, which lasted for two days.

So time has come for recapitulating what we did during this year and also for some of us – for example me – it is time to hand over our ideas, visions and tasks to the ones that are joining the Helmholtz Juniors for 2016.\nAs this process of recapitulating is not meant to be exclusively for ourselves, the Helmholtz Juniors newsletter 2015 was written to give others the opportunity to see and read what we did.\nWhen working on the newsletter, together with my fellow Communication Group mates I realized that it is quite a lot that has been achieved during the year and that some of these achievements may be the foundation for interesting developments in the near future.\nI have to confess that I did not expect this conclusion. The work on my tasks in the Communication group always seemed to suffer from the PhD workload and resulting small amounts of time that I could invest in doing and organizing the tasks we agreed upon. But as I said before, sitting in my gloomy office and writing this lines (the office is not so gloomy actually) I have the feeling that we did a good job and I want to use this post as an opportunity to thank my fellow group mates and all the people that were working in the other Helmholtz Juniors groups for doing a great job.\nIf you doubt my words, have a look into our newsletter :)\n","date":"2016-02-04T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2016/02/helmholtz-juniors-annual-newsletter-of-2015/images/LOGO_Blue2_hu_9d5b6c02b5703be9.png","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2016/02/helmholtz-juniors-annual-newsletter-of-2015/","title":"Helmholtz Juniors annual newsletter of 2015"},{"content":"Beginning the PhD often marks a new episode in one’s life. Maybe it involves moving to a new city or even a new country, maybe it means getting in touch with the German bureaucracy (there is a reason for its negative reputation) for the first time and ultimately it for sure means being confronted with rights and duties of a supervised PhD candidate.\nIn order to provide advice and a helping hand when facing any of these issues – or others that I didn’t mention here – we, the Helmholtz Juniors, gathered lots and lots of information and put them into our handbook:\nPHD IN THE HELMHOLTZ ASSOCIATION A HANDBOOK FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE PHD CANDIDATES IN THE HELMHOLTZ ASSOCIATION.\nThe name may be long but the information provided inside is to the point and well readable (my opinion at least) using short paragraphs and often a question-and-answer design.\nSome may think “Hey wait, we have something similar at our center already!” That’s true. In a short survey we saw that 11 out of 15 Helmholtz Centers, whose PhD representative groups took part in the survey, already have some information material for new PhDs or foreign colleagues.\nNonetheless we think that our handbook is an additional source of information worth having a look at. It was written by PhD students for PhD students and greatly benefits from the experiences that the writers made during their time at their centers. And while the PhD info material in some centers is a bit short on content, our handbook covers a great many of aspects one may be interested in regardless if he or she is new or advanced PhD candidate.\nSo last words here from me: Give it a try!

It was the second Mid-Term Meeting ever and proved to be a great opportunity to meet each other again, to discuss the latest progress and problems, and to improve the cooperation of the Helmholtz Juniors.\nOn Monday, the first day of the meeting, we were welcomed by Caroline Krüger from the Helmholtz head office. The working phase was opened up with presentations from all Helmholtz Juniors working groups on the activities of the last half year and on future plans for the upcoming half year. Afterwards two guests from the Helmholtz Head Office gave a parallel session on two of the main topics we deal with. Elsbeth Lesner was guest of a discussion round on working conditions, PhD contracts and stipends. Jennifer Schevardo gave a firm presentation on different networks within the Helmholtz Community with a focus on the new “Helmholtz \u0026amp; Friends” Alumni network. “Helmholtz \u0026amp; Friends” aims to strengthen the Helmholtz-Feeling within the Association and initiates the build-up of a new network of peers that provide exchange of knowledge basically concentrating on social skills and leadership (Helmholtz \u0026amp; Friends).\nAfter lunch – a delicious one by the way – our next guest was Sabine Helling-Moegen, the administrative head of the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE). She gave a brief overview of the history of the German “Großforschungseinrichtungen” and of the the Helmholtz Association and described the process from narrow research topics towards nowadays program oriented research and the program oriented funding (“Programmorientierte Förderung”, POF). The interesting talk and the following discussion gave us the opportunity to gain a better understanding of mechanisms and politics in science and education in general and in the Helmholtz Association, in particular.\nThe last part of the first day was dedicated to a discussion on an overall strategy of the Helmholtz Juniors and on tasks for upcoming half year and their priority:\nfocus for the working conditions group: reduce number of in-house stipends and increase number of vacation days to 28 or 30 improve the motivation of all PhD students to be part in the local PhD representative initiatives and in the Helmholtz Juniors. enhance visibility of the Helmholtz Juniors: Only if we are visible, we can change something. strengthen the connection to the HGF head office strengthen our network to other groups which work for improving working conditions in science improve continuity after handover to new Helmholtz Juniors The first day was concluded with dinner in a nice restaurant in Berlin‘s center.\nThe second day of our Mid-term meeting was dedicated towards group work. The working conditions group recapitulated their meeting with Elsbeth Lesner from the previous day. The Event group started planning a Helmholtz PhD day which should take place in 2016. Both, the Survey and the Communications working groups attended an Q\u0026amp;A session with Jan-Martin Wiarda, Bianca Berlin and Janine Tychsen from the Helmholtz Communications and Media Relations Office. The three of them were faced with several questions on internal and external communication issues. Besides receiving useful answers, possible contacts for our communication-related issues, and insight into the current projects of their group, we were encouraged to raise a critical voice inside and outside of the Helmholtz Association whenever necessary.\nWith a wrap-up and a basket of tasks for the upcoming months, we finished our Mid-term meeting in the early afternoon.\nAt this point we, the Helmholtz Juniors, want to thank all our guests, the Helmholtz Association\u0026rsquo;s Head Office and the events working group.

(You can listen to the German report / interview following this link).\nSo what’s behind that big name that provides science with high-speed internet? First a short detour on history.\nThe internet that has a multitude of uses nowadays was originally designed to provide better ways for communication and data exchange for two groups of players. The military and the scientific community. This initial phase was dated in the 60’s and 70’s and the place of happening was … the United States of America, of course [1]. It was in the beginning 80s that Europe and later Germany made their leaps in terms of scientific computer networking with the “Deutsches Forschungsnetz” being founded, which is until now connecting German university and research facilities and the rest of the world. On the European level the backbone was developed consecutively, each new project with a fancier name than the previous one (IXI, EMPB, TEN-155 just to name some examples, for more see [2]).\nIt was then in 2001 that the new European backbone, funded by the European Union, with the name of GÉANT started working. While having assigned the name GÉANT2 for some years, it returned to its original name GÉANT in 2009.\nToday GÉANT connects the National Research and Education Networks (NREN) of about 40 European countries with each other [3] and also with the rest of the world (figure below). It provides a maximum network bandwidth of 500Gbps (gigabits per second) in the core network and has the capacity to be upgraded to 8 Tbps (terabits per second) [4]. With these characteristics, GÉANT is currently the world’s most advanced research and education network [5].\nWhy do we need such a data-transferring capacity one may ask?\nAs research is becoming more and more of a collaborative work, communication of participants across any distance becomes more and more important as well. This communication is not only about sharing ideas but also about sharing and storing data. In some cases huge amounts of data as for example CERN, one of GÉANT’s partners, produces one petabyte of data (= 1000 terabytes) every day [7]. The infrastructure that enables this communication is called e-infrastructure. Besides networks, such e-infrastructure also includes data storage and processing functionality. GÉANT was designed to be the “flagship” of the European e-infrastructure and looking at some of the numbers written earlier it seems to do a good job.\nFor myself I am looking forward hearing more from GÉANTs future development. Not necessarily while being stuck in a traffic jam.\nFor anyone who wants to know more about the project. The internet page contains a lot of nice (but sometimes outdated) information. In the meanwhile the GÉANT staff is working on a new web presence that can be found here.\nReferences:\n[1] - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet\n[2] - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DANTE\n[3] - http://www.geant.net/About/Value_of_GEANT/Pages/10_Years_of_the_G%C3%89ANT_network.aspx\n[4] - http://www.geant.org/geantproject/Network/Pages/Home.aspx\n[5] - http://www.geant.net/MediaCentreEvents/PressKit/Pages/default.aspx\n[6] - http://www.geant.org/geantproject/Network/Pages/Global_Connectivity.aspx\n[7] - http://home.web.cern.ch/about/computing\n","date":"2015-07-06T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/07/g%C3%A9ant-faster-than-light-almost-european-research-network/images/GEANT_logo_2015_hu_b2de912b0bc6c2fa.jpg","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/07/g%C3%A9ant-faster-than-light-almost-european-research-network/","title":"GÉANT - faster than light (almost) European research network"},{"content":"by Stephan Körner, Julian Gethmann and Juliane Hafermann\nLast week, we reported about the changes in the way PhD students are to be treated in the Helmholtz Association. As could be read in the German news in March and April 2015, the Max Planck Society has meanwhile not been inactive: On March 23rd, the Max Planck Society published a press release presenting a plan to spend “50 million Euro for junior scientists”.\nBasically, one can split the attempts to improve the situation of PhD students and postdocs into two parts: give every doctoral student and every PostDoc a contract and improve the supervision by providing at least a second Professor as supervisor and mentor.\n== The two-class society of stipend holders and contract holders==\nWith more than 3400 stipend funded PhD students, the Max Planck Society is one of the biggest providers of PhD positions in Germany. Many PhD students come from abroad, and until now most of them have been provided with a stipend instead of a regular contract. But what is the problem with stipends? Although stipends offer benefits like more independence, they have some major disadvantages like lack of social securities, health and unemployment insurance, parental leave and pension, to name just a few. A more detailed description of the pros and cons of stipends can be found here.\nTo eliminate this funding-based difference between PhD students, the Max Planck Society will spend 50 million Euro per year to provide contracts instead of stipends to all of their doctoral students and postdocs. Furthermore, these contracts are granted for three years with an opportunity to extend for another year, so that students can focus on their work instead of worrying about follow-up funding.\nOne of the drawbacks of conventional staff contracts, however, is that PhD students also have to work on projects not related to their PhD topic (as it is e. g. still usual in engineering), such as giving lectures, supervising practical courses or performing routine tasks for their institute. Similar to the independence of these tasks granted by a stipend and unlike conventional contracts, these new PhD contracts are designed to ensure that you are not working on unrelated topics, but only on your own project. However, some drawbacks remain: there are exceptions to the no-stipend rule for guests working “on a particular project and for a limited time” who can still be funded by stipends without social security. These new guidelines do not affect any existing contracts or stipends and it is still unclear what the actual contracts encompass with regards to salary and benefits.\n== Supervision ==\nThe second big issue addressed is the situation of supervision of doctoral students and their perspectives after finishing the PhD. The Max Planck Society is aware of the situation that less than 10 % of PhDs stay in science. Therefore more than 90 % of the PhD students would benefit from courses and programs preparing them for jobs in industry or economy.\nAnother more challenging approach for improving this situation is setting up contracts between the candidate, the supervising professor and another third person at a university. In the case of conflict between candidate and supervisor the third person mediates between the supervisor and the PhD student. The President of the Max Planck Society, Martin Statmann, hopes that each Professor supervising a student recognises and clearly communicates if a doctoral student is well suited for a career in research or if other branches seem to be more promising for the student.\nIn summary, this new development at the Max Planck Society is a big step in the right direction with still some minor flaws.\n","date":"2015-05-21T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/05/max-planck-society-implements-much-needed-changes-in-phd-funding/images/800px-Euro_Banknotes_hu_c052eadb501ed935.jpg","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/05/max-planck-society-implements-much-needed-changes-in-phd-funding/","title":"Max-Planck society implements much-needed changes in PhD funding"},{"content":"by Juliane Hafermann, Julian Gethmann and Stephan Körner (Helmholtz Juniors Survey Group)\nThings are moving in the scientific world: the working conditions of PhD students in two large German scientific societies, the Helmholtz Association and the Max Planck Society, will be improved dramatically. This week we will present recent developments at the Helmholtz Association. Stay tuned for more insights into the changes at the Max Planck society next week.\nThe Helmholtz Association recently made huge progress in the way they treat PhD students. A working group chaired by Prof. Dirk Heinz and coordinated by Nina Löchte (who is responsible for the promotion of young and early-stage researchers and international networking) has prepared guidelines for the completion of PhD projects within the Helmholtz Association. The Helmholtz Juniors, PhD representatives from every Helmholtz Centre in Germany, were also heard and involved in the process of writing these guidelines.\nAs Germany’s largest scientific research organisation, the Helmholtz Association comprises 18 research centres working in six different fields: Energy, Earth and Environment, Health, Aeronautics, Space and Transport as well as Key Technologies plus Matter. A total of 36,000 staff work there, approximately 6,500 of them PhD students.\nThese PhD students make a significant contribution to the research and the successes of the Helmholtz Association. Thus, the Helmholtz Association is interested in promoting and supporting them and their career with a talent management concept. 34 Research Schools and Graduate Schools have already been set up by the Helmholtz Association, offering a structured education and training for doctoral students.\nSetting up the Graduate and Research Schools had been a first important step. Since then, further measures have been taken to improve the situation of PhD students within the Helmholtz Association. The Helmholtz PhD guidelines are an agreement on minimum standards that have to be met for the completion of PhD projects under optimal conditions. They strive to provide a wide range of training and development opportunities in order to prepare PhD students for their future careers in academia or industry as well as outside of research positions. Their aim is to create a common quality to the PhD training at all Helmholtz Centres, facilitate quality assurance and give guidance to both PhD students and their supervisors.\nThe guidelines make several recommendations for best practice during PhD training with the aim to turn these best practice examples into the minimal standards of PhD training within the Helmholtz Association. They endorse Research Schools and Graduate Schools, which provide a structured training and educational programme according to the needs of the individual PhD student.\nAt least 9 out of the 18 Helmholtz centres award stipends, and according to the latest Helmholtz Juniors Survey, 22 % of the survey participants are funded by a stipend. While stipends allow for more independence than conventional contracts do, they do not include health and pension insurance or other social securities. A more detailed comparison between stipends and contracts as well as all their benefits and drawbacks was published by the Helmholtz Juniors Working Conditions Group. The text is available in both German and English and can be found here: Detailed information on stipends.\nIn order to further improve the working conditions and the social security of PhD students in particular, the guidelines are an important step in the right direction as they advocate paid contracted positions including social security contributions. Furthermore, the guidelines state that the contract period should equal the expected duration of the PhD, with an optional extension period and additional funding until the dissertation is submitted in case the project cannot be completed within the allotted time frame. However, stipends as such are not ruled out, and awarding them as a source of funding for PhD students remains a possibility, leaving an obvious loophole.\nThe guidelines promote a system where the doctoral students do not solely depend on the goodwill of their supervisor. Instead, a committee of at least three scientists (one of them the primary supervisor) is to be informed about and consulted on the progress of the PhD project. This committee may furthermore give advice on career options and strategic questions during the PhD.\nPhD students are to be seen as “junior researchers undergoing preparation for their future careers through the process of completing a PhD”. The guidelines thus endorse support for career development, such as career advice and mentoring programmes for PhD students as well as career planning support after completion of the PhD.\nThe formation of student bodies – such as PhD representatives at the individual centres or the Helmholtz Juniors as an association-wide PhD student body – is encouraged. That way, PhD students can get involved in future decisions affecting them and the support they receive.\nThese guidelines are certainly a great basis for the completion of PhD projects within the Helmholtz Association. However, there is one big drawback. So far, the guidelines are only best practice examples and recommendations. Every Helmholtz centre is technically free to choose which ones to implement and which ones to ignore. Furthermore, the situation of postdocs has not been addressed so far, which is another potential issue.\nMany of the Helmholtz centres have already set up conditions according to in accordance with parts of the guidelines, while still falling a short in other parts. In general, however, most PhD students enjoy good working conditions in the Helmholtz Association. The establishment of the PhD guidelines show that the necessity for changes has been recognised and that there is a willingness to improve the situation.\n","date":"2015-05-09T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/05/helmholtz-associationimproved-conditions-for-phd-students/images/phd-guidelines1_hu_86aea4339ad9814c.jpg","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/05/helmholtz-associationimproved-conditions-for-phd-students/","title":"Helmholtz Association—improved conditions for PhD students"},{"content":" This blog post is a statement of the Helmholtz Juniors.\nFollowed by media response, the Max Planck Society recently announced dramatic changes in their support for doctoral students [1]. Without notable public attention, the Helmholtz Association also released their new guidelines for the completion of PhD projects [2]. These guidelines had been developed in the course of the last year with contributions of the Helmholtz Juniors.\nIn their guidelines, both large German research institutions stress the importance of doctoral students as first stage researchers who contribute significantly to the efforts of the research associations. The proclaimed aim is to support doctoral students at this career stage by offering appropriate structures, i.e. with regard to supervision, training, work infrastructures and career development.\nThe aspect drawing most attention on Max Planck was the announcement to bring the current scholarship practices to a termination and to offer every PhD student a support contract. The controversial issue of scholarships had been criticized in the past [3]. As Helmholtz Juniors we are delighted to see this shift in public opinion: That employment contracts (with social security benefits) for the whole time of the PhD project are seen as standard with scholarships being the exception, when appropriate. This is also how the Helmholtz Association formulates their vision on the PhD period in the newly released guidelines and how it is already implemented in most of the Helmholtz centers.\nAs the new guidelines of the Helmholtz Association are only recommendations for the practice in the different Helmholtz centers, we are looking forward to collaborate with the centers to set this new framework into action on a local level. We hope that the new guidelines as well as the shift in public opinion can enhance a constructive dialogue on the situation of doctoral candidates in those centers of the Helmholtz Association where scholarship holders form the majority of PhD students.\nYou want to know more about the issue of scholarships versus contracts, the new Helmholtz guidelines and the announced changes at the Max Planck Society?

One such major research field is Marine science. Recently, lot of focus has been put on marine research to address some of the major threats to the world’s ocean. Studies suggest ocean is greatly influenced by the anthropogenic activities, such as CO2 emissions. Changes in physics and chemistry of the ocean can have negative impact on the global climate and human society as well. Therefore, it is important that we start thinking about conserving our oceans (it’s high time now). Research institutes like GEOMAR, AWI etc. under Helmholtz umbrella are already addressing many of the scientific questions related to the change in the global ocean. There are many projects funded by German agencies and international agencies that are investigating impact of global climate change on the oceans and it’s feedback to the atmosphere. Once such project is SOPRAN, many research centers/universities like GEOMAR, AWI, Hamburg University etc. are part of SOPRAN project. This blog is on the SOPRAN annual meeting, which took place last month to highlight some of the key researches going on in SOPRAN and also the journey of SOPRAN.\nSOPRAN is a joint project funded by BMBF (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung ) as well as SOLAS which is an international project. SOPRAN focuses on research related to atmosphere-ocean interactions, covering key aspects such as:\nHow changes in the atmospheric composition affects ocean ecosystem dynamics e.g. Global warming, Ocean acidification\nHow climate related changes in the surface ocean processes (upwelling, mixing, photoacclimation etc.) affects oceanic emissions to the atmosphere\nQuantifying rate of mass and energy fluxes exchanged between ocean and atmosphere\nThis year’s SOPRAN annual meeting took place at Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz. Meeting started on 17/03/2015 at 14.00, Dr. Jonanthan Williams who is the head of research unit “Organic reactive species” in the Atmospheric chemistry department welcomed us and gave us the overview of the institute. We started with sharing some light moments over coffee and general introduction. Meeting officially kicked off with an introductory speech by Dr. Hermann Bange who is a senior scientist at GEOMAR, Kiel and also the scientific coordinator of SOPRAN. As he went on with his speech, we learnt about the progress of research works under SOPRAN umbrella and I have no hesitation to say it loud that senior and junior scientist involved in these research works have done a remarkable job. They came up with amazing findings/results and some of them are already published. Dr. Bange informed us that SOPRAN project in totality is a great success. However, we had mixed feelings because we knew that SOPRAN is coming to the end next year in January but at the same time we all showed commitment to take the legacy of SOPRAN forward. After the introductory speech, it was time for the overview talks. We learnt about the developments and scientific work, which are in progress under different research “themes” in SOPRAN by the respective PIs (principle investigators). After the overview talks we again went for a coffee session which was dominated by the exchange of scientific ideas between the peers. In the evening we had a poster session (of course with the coffee and cookies). Some of the posters out there blew me away, the work was mind-boggling. I enjoyed reading all of them but some of the research that fascinated were:\n“Halocarbon emissions from the Baltic sea and how they alters atmospheric composition“\n“Role of bacteria in degrading halocarbons in the oceans“\n“Emission of sea salt aerosols from the oceans and their impact on atmospheric radiation“\n“Understanding influence of winds on accumulation of the organic matter on the sea surface by Aeolotron experiment”\n“Understanding the effect of ocean acidification on the dynamics of the pelagic ecosystem from the diverse mesocosm experiments”\n“Modeling effect of mineral dust on the cloud chemistry in the Cape Verde region”\n“ Inferring coastal upwelling velocities from the helium isotopes in the Peruvian upwelling region”\nThe showstopper for the evening came in form of lovely dinner at a restaurant in the city center. The vintage champagne in the restaurant greeted us and we all raised a toast for the success of SOPRAN. Next day we started the meeting with the “highlight” talks by the young scientists. Talks were amazing, addressing different scientific questions and approaches. I also gave a talk on my current research work, which is in the direction of addressing the question: “Effect of CO2 changes on the phytoplankton dynamics”. It was pleasing to see people were interested in my talk and afterwards gave me some useful inputs. That’s something I love about giving talks, you get some really valuable feedbacks. After the “highlight” talks, we discussed about the future of SOPRAN, some administrative stuff and also about the synthesis paper will be released sometime later in this year. Synthesis paper will summarize all the scientific accomplishments of the SOPRAN. The official end of the “SOPRAN annual meeting 2015“ was marked by the nice afternoon lunch and beverages.\nTo sum up, I thoroughly enjoyed the meeting and it was great learning and networking experience.\n","date":"2015-04-02T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/04/sopran-annual-meeting-2015/images/SOPRAN_logo_circle_hu_10b7e6c5270f549b.jpg","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/04/sopran-annual-meeting-2015/","title":"SOPRAN annual meeting 2015"},{"content":"\nOn the sidelines of the Helmholtz Juniors Annual Meeting in January, an interesting idea came up: our work would be much easier if there was a strong sense of community – in other words, if we “felt more Helmholtz”. As the well-known blue-white Helmholtz logo can be found on the websites (just have a look at the top of this page), letter paper, business cards, etc. of each Centre, I wondered what this name actually represents and started looking for clues\u0026hellip;\nThe patron of the Helmholtz Association is Hermann von Helmholtz, one of the leading natural scientists of the 19th century. He was interested in a wide range of scientific research and technological practice covering the fields of physics, medicine, mathematics and chemistry as well as psychology, philosophy and music. He was one of the last all-round academics not specialized in only one field. His inventions successfully linked theoretical approaches, experiments and practical applications.\nBiography\nBorn 1821 in Potsdam as Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand Helmholtz (the “von” came much later with his ennoblement), he was interested in the natural sciences ever since his early youth. As requested by his father and for financial reasons, he studied at the Berlin Military Academy and obtained his Doctor of Medicine at the age of 21. Over the years, he took several academic positions: associate professor of physiology at the Prussian University of Königsberg (1849, after being recommended by Alexander von Humboldt), professor of anatomy and physiology at the University of Bonn (1855), professor of physiology at the University of Heidelberg (1858) and finally, professor of physics at the University of Berlin (from 1871).\nIn 1887 the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (PTR) was founded in Charlottenburg as the first non-university research centre worldwide and Helmholtz was not only one of the founders but also the first president. The PTR was kind of a forerunner for the present-day Helmholtz Association (and by the way, it still exists as the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany’s national metrology institute). Helmholtz was married twice and had three sons and two daughters. 1894 he died in Charlottenburg and was buried in a “grave of honour” at a cemetery in Berlin-Wannsee.\nResearch and Innovations\nHelmholtz made many outstanding contributions in a great range of scientific fields. As it would be impossible to mention them all in this blog entry, I focussed on several significant ones.\nIn physiology and psychology, his research dealt with the mathematics of the eye and theories of vision, such as colour vision and the visual perception of space, as well as perception of sound and the sensation of tone.\nHis first contribution to physics was a theoretical research on the conversation of energy for which he formulated a law. He also was the first scientist ever to measure the wavelengths of UV light and determine the capacity of a light microscope. His “three component theory of colour vision” which replaced the earlier six component model became especially relevant for colour television much later. In the field of acoustics, he worked on the theory of air speed in open tubes and his research on hydrodynamics and electrodynamics set new standards for the coming generations. A device still used nowadays is the Helmholtz coil, which is able to produce a region of almost uniform magnetic field.\nIn mathematics, he made a major impact on modern meteorology as he studied thunderstorms, cyclones, water waves and air waves. The mathematical formulation of the first theorem of thermodynamics also goes back to Helmholtz. The partial differential Helmholtz equation is often used in physical studies of problems in both space and time domain and was named for him.\nIn the field of optics, he invented the ophthalmoscope (in German “Augenspiegel”), an instrument to visualize the retina of the eye for the first time ever, which made him suddenly world-famous. Another instrument developed by him is the ophtalmometer, which is used to measure the curvature of the surface of the cornea.\nAdditionally, Helmholtz was also interested in philosophy. In this field, he developed theories about the philosophy of science and the link between the laws of nature and perception.\nWith all that in mind, it is obvious why the six research fields of the Helmholtz Association cover the wide range of Energy, Earth and Environment, Health, Aeronautics, Space and Transport, Key Technologies and Matter. The Helmholtz Juniors come from all the different Helmholtz Centres and therefore represent this broad bandwidth. For a good sense of community and a successful teamwork in 2015, I hope very much that we will all feel “a bit more Helmholtz” and maybe this article helps a little bit on the way there\u0026hellip;\nReferences:\n[1] http://www.helmholtz.de/en/about_us/history_of_the_helmholtz_association/hermann_von_helmholtz/\n[2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_von_Helmholtz\n[3] „Ehrengrab Lindenstr 1 (Zehld) Hermann Helmholtz“.

Since Open Access is such a great success, I want to give a short overview about history, different types to realize Open Access and the future development from Open Access to Open Science.\nA brief look backwards\nFor more than ten years, the thought of open and free accessible research has been developed in the science landscape. A first big point was the “Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities”[1] in 2003, which was signed by the largest German research organizations like Helmholtz Association, Max Planck Society, Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft or Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFG and by international research organizations like Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) or Institut National del la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM). With this Berlin Declaration the major research organizations in Germany voted for Open Access in Science. Since then different declarations and guidelines for Open Access have been published. For example, the G8 Science Ministers declared at their meeting in June 2013 in London “We share the intention, therefore, to continue our cooperative efforts and will consider how best to address the global promotion of increasing public access to the results of publicly funded published research including to peer-reviewed published research and research data.”\nThe European Commission made Open Access a general principle of EU’s Research \u0026amp; Innovation funding programme for 2014-2020, Horizon 2020. Thus, all articles produced with funding from Horizon 2020 will have to be available via one of the two recommended types of Open Access:\nThe golden way\nThe golden way of Open Access describes research publication in Open Access Journals. These Journals are accessible without any charge for the reader. Different Open Access publisher compensate the lack of subscription fees by different ways, such as funding organisations or article processing fees (the author’s institution pays for publishing).\nThe green way\nThe green way describes the possibility of a so-called secondary publication. About 80 % of all journals of STM publisher (Scientific, Technical and Medical publisher) allow, with some restrictions, a publication of the accepted manuscript via an institutional repository, which makes the paper publicly available. This secondary publication must have the same content but do not need the same type setting. A typical restriction is a moratorium which has to be kept before publishing the paper a second time. Whether the secondary or primary publication is used for further research, you always have to cite the primary publication.\nIn Germany, the Bundestag supports secondary publications with a change in “Urheberrechtsgesetz”. With the made change, a research paper can be secondary published after 12 months, whether the publisher agrees or not, if the following points are met:\nThe research was funded publicly by at least 50 % The journal is published at least twice a year The secondary publication will not serve a commercial purpose. For the sake of completeness, I should mention that traditional publisher try to keep up with Open Access and offer the possibility to make your paper publicly available within a subscription journal. But you have to be careful with this so called hybrid solution: You will have to pay higher article processing fees than in Open Access journals and your institution will pay nevertheless subscription fees to offer all other papers form this journal to you. Furthermore the green way is possible in most cases.\nKeep Open Access in your mind\nMaking science available for a larger community via Open Access is an ongoing process. Open Access has a great support from different research organizations to political institutions up to the EU and G8. It is always worth to consider the possibility to publish the golden way or, at least, push the secondary publication via the green way. Within the Helmholtz Association the working group Open Science informs you about all possibilities of Open Access in general and provides contact information to all the working group members at your institute: http://oa.helmholtz.de/\nA brief look forward\nOpen and free accessibility of research paper is on the move. However, research is not only done by writing a paper. It contains also collected data and written software to process the data. This is clarified by the term of Open Science. There are more and more efforts to make data accessible for example worldwide databases like the World Data System WDS[2] or the Data repository PANGEA[3]. Additionally, it is also possible to publish data as supplementary to a research paper and do this via a data repository of your institution.\n[1] http://www.icsu-wds.org/\n[2] http://www.helmholtz.de/mediathek/reden/artikel/4/federal_government_offers_prize_for_responsibly_acting_enterprises/\n[3] http://www.pangaea.de/\n","date":"2015-02-06T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/02/open-access-making-science-visible/images/OAlogo_ccby-e1423243046288_hu_6a54ed51fc8c61f6.jpg","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/02/open-access-making-science-visible/","title":"Open Access – Making Science Visible"},{"content":"This year’s annual meeting of the Helmholtz Juniors took place at the Alfred-Wegener-Institut (AWI) from the 14th to the 16th of January. New Helmholtz Juniors were introduced. We re-formed our working groups, elected new speakers and had interesting discussions and a nice time.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the last year’s speakers Nicholas Engel and Sripriya Murthy welcomed the previous and new Helmholtz Juniors to the meeting. The speakers of last year’s working groups presented their work and achievements and suggested topics for 2015. The survey group has finished the first evaluation of the 2014 survey. The evaluation is currently discussed and will be released roughly within the next two months. Further groups are “communication”, “event”, “working conditions” and “steadification”. See our homepage (www.helmholtz.de/hejus) for details on these groups. In the evening, the new Helmholtz Juniors chose their working groups. The groups of 2014 will be kept in 2015 and no new ones were established.\nThe second day started with a talk of Karin Lochte, head of the Alfred-Wegener-Institut, followed by a question and discussion session with her. After taking our group picture (the cover picture of the entry) we got a guided tour on the work of the AWI. Before lunch we met with Claudia Hanfland who coordinates the POLMAR graduate school (polmar.awi.de) and currently represents all Helmholtz graduate schools as their speaker. We discussed about the relevance of graduate schools and their function.\nIn the afternoon, we had group working sessions in which the previous group’s speakers handed over their work to the new members. The first hours of group work were quite productive and we collected lots of new ideas and plans for 2015. Have a look on the picture of our group work sessions below!\nWe started on Friday with group working sessions and with electing group speakers. After that Xixi Feng presented PhDnet (www.phdnet.mpg.de) which is the PhD candidate representation of the Max Planck Society. She is one of the speakers of PhDnet. There are some intersections in the topics on which HeJu and PhDnet work such as regular contracts instead of scholarships. Therefore we started sending speakers to each other’s annual meetings.\nThe last points on the agenda were the elections for the two HeJu speakers of 2015 and the decision on the location for the next year’s annual meeting. Daniel Neumann (Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht) and Meike Köhler (Helmholtz Zentrum München) were elected as speakers. The next year’s meeting will take place at the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) in Oberpfaffenhofen, close to Munich.\nWe would like to thank Renate Degen very much for organising the event in Bremerhaven. Also, we would like to thank the Helmholtz Association and the Alfred-Wegener-Institut very much for their financial support and for offering a location.\n","date":"2015-01-25T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/01/helmholtz-juniors-annual-meeting-2015-in-bremerhaven/images/Helmholtz-Juniors_FB-scaled_hu_bee763f0bbf7e18d.jpg","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/01/helmholtz-juniors-annual-meeting-2015-in-bremerhaven/","title":"Helmholtz Juniors Annual Meeting 2015 in Bremerhaven"},{"content":"The New Year 2015 is already a couple of days old. Let’s have a look back on the work of Helmholtz-Juniors (HeJu) in 2014 and take a look ahead to what’s to expect for 2015. Yuan (see authors) compiled our current HeJu-Newsletter2014 which gives you an overview about the work of 2014 and our contacts.\nFrom January 22 to 24, 2014 the HeJus were kindly hosted by the Helmholtz Centre Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) in Dresden for their annual meeting. During that meeting the working groups presented their achievements of the previous term, and new goals where set for the next HeJu, namely us (most members are only active for one year, a list of currently active members you can find here). The most important goals being set the realization of the Helmholtz PhD survey 2014 (survey group), the active participation in the formulation of an updated version of the official Helmholtz doctoral training guidelines (working conditions group), the finalization of “the PhD booklet” (communication group) and coming up with a new concept for an interdisciplinary event for PhDs of the Helmholtz Association (HA) (events group). We also spoke with a Helmholtz official about financial support for our plans and the function and position of the HeJu within the HA. Additionally, we welcomed a representative of PhDnet, the PhD network of the Max Planck Society (MPG). Although being an official part of the MPG, they are known to be very critical towards their mother organization and fight for just working conditions and appropriate remuneration. They shared valuable information about their experience within the MPG and how they are organizing themselves. Vice versa Sripriya, one of our spokespersons last year, attended the annual meeting of PhDnet in Heidelberg later in 2014 and brought back interesting ideas for funding new events.\nWe also discussed current problems. For instance only 14 of the 18 Helmholtz centres were represented at the HeJu annual meeting, despite the centres agreeing to cover travel expenses for the meeting. Some representatives complained that the general will of students to engage for a representative function (meaning the DokTeams or PhD initiatives) at the individual centres was rather low among PhD students. It was also pointed out that there were difficulties in reaching all the PhD students working at one centre due to size, structural organization and the lack of networking possibilities. Other problems included the identification of the basic needs of PhD students of different subjects and at different centres (for instance: significantly lower salaries for PhDs in life science than for PhDs in engineering or similar subjects, not to mention PhDs in social science or the ones living on stipends).\nFrom July 21 to 22 the HeJu met again at a mid-term meeting at the HA’s headquarters in Berlin thanks to the efforts of the events team who managed to get us comfortable in Berlin, and in touch with the headquarters for 2 days. This time 16 out of 18 centres were represented. A more detailed report about this event you can find here. This gave us the possibility to check up on the progress of single projects and to rethink others. Just before the meeting the survey group put their questionnaire online and was able to show first figures (I hope you all took part!). The fully analysed results will soon follow (see below). Also a new working group was formed: the embodiment group. Inspired by the organization of PhDnet, its members were to evaluate if becoming an official body of the HA (including a fixed annual budget) was worth giving up our current independence. The working conditions group was actually able to leave their critical mark on the new doctoral training guidelines (to be released this year) and the communication group was invited to take a look behind the HA public relation department in order to increase HeJu\u0026rsquo;s visibility at the Helmholtz centres and beyond. As a result, we have this blog online since September 2014 and we hope you enjoy reading it. We will use it to keep you all updated about our work and also hope to get some discussions going about PhD life (or after life) in general. Feel free to leave your comments and ideas and have a look on our website and our new facebook page as well.\nSo, what’s to come in 2015? Big milestone ahead of course: the annual HeJu meeting at the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in Bremerhaven this week from January 14 to 16! There we will see how happy YOU are and at which centre you are happiest according to the results of the Helmholtz PhD survey. Information, each individual centre is also very interested in. We will present an online version of the PhD booklet (due to difficulties with the layout, a print version will only be available at a later time point but, we wanted to make sure that you can access this information asap). We hope that many of new and old PhD students in Germany will find it very useful. We will discuss our impact on the new Helmholtz doctoral training guidelines and the pros and cons of an official embodiment within the HA. We will see what concept the event group came up with and if we will again get support for an additional mid-term meeting. One of the more difficult topics is the question if PhD students should get stipends or contracts. There is a will of the HA to provide each PhD student with a contract rather than a stipend but, this is, of course, not yet reality. Given the tight financial situation for personnel money in science in general and at certain centres in particular, this will still be an issue in the future. An issue that probably has to be discussed with Otmar Wiestler, now head of the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), who will replace Jürgen Mlynek after 10 years as HA\u0026rsquo;s new president in September this year.\nA very important point will be the handing over of our work to the ones of you that will take over our tasks. Due to the short HeJu terms, a thorough transfer of information is crucial for an efficient continuation. Thus, let’s look forward to what the next HeJu generation will have in store for us. I will surely keep checking up on the news here. Good luck! :)\n","date":"2015-01-12T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/01/goodbye-2014-hello-2015-bring-it-on/images/HeJu2015_hu_f8f3c156caa0e1c7.jpg","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/01/goodbye-2014-hello-2015-bring-it-on/","title":"Goodbye 2014, Hello 2015: Bring it on!"},{"content":"As we all head toward the Christmas break there is time for one more Helmholtz Juniors Blog Post. The Christmas break can be a time of relaxation, a time to gain perspective or a time of indeterminable stress. Getting up and leaving your desk as break time approaches can be a difficult task, even more so when impossible deadlines loom in the New Year. Reintegrating with family and friends can be challenging. Inane friendly questions such as; how is the thesis going, or when do you think you will be finished, can take on a diabolical edge. As a result, these questions are just as likely to elicit a rage driven series of superlatives as a blank stare. If a constant feeling of walking on glass is something you and those around you would like to avoid. Here are some suggestions to make the Christmas break what it should be!\nBe prepared\nYou are always going to get questions that remind you of your PhD and everything that is wrong with it. For most people questions about work are like questions about weather. Treat them the same way. Its unlikely that your aunty Bob really wants to know the problems you’re having at work. Even if you tell her she will probably be lost at the half of a sentence you utter. Realise it’s a weather question, smile and give whatever polite response you feel like. It helps to be at peace with that status of your work before entering the situation but that’s a pipe dream for most. Just remember every other PhD student out there is feeling the same pain. For those around PhD students, don’t ask. Just don’t. Under no circumstances is it ok to bring up the proverbial PhD elephant.\nCompanionship of contemporaries\nIf your lucky enough to have a friendship group undertaking a PhD at the same take, advantage of it! They will know, they will understand and most of all their disaster stories will make you feel better about what ever train wreck you are currently riding. Remember to return the favour. Avoid those who have just finished, their satisfied smile is a thing of nightmares to those that are not quite there yet.\nProductivity\nNothing helps guilt better than getting something done about it. If your contemplating working over the Christmas break then set strict guidelines for yourself. In particular, success criteria that are achievable. Even if you don’t feel like you are on holiday everyone else will assume you are. They may well view your work as less serious because your doing it in your free time. No PhD student wants this, the sacrifice to work on your own time is something that is never given lightly.The last thing you want is people seeing it as a hobby. Setting time for your work and time for life helps with this. Make appointments accordingly and make sure to take the time for the special events. This might be the last time you see these people before your finished when life will change and you will never be the same. Remember it may be impossible to get everything you want done but set goals you can achieve. A strict time schedule can help with this. Work the time allocated, not more.\nGifts A good thoughtful gift can always make Christmas that much brighter. A good smart gift for a PhD student can reinvigorate the interest and motivation that has been drained over the last year. It may even end up saving the PhD student huge amounts of time. Here are some suggestions easily available for purchase on amazon:\nThe unwritten rules of PHD research (Author: Marian Petre) This is a useful book for those starting out or even for those who are close to the end, it can be real eye opener to those just making the transition to graduate study.\nHow to write a better thesis (Author: David Evans) This is a book for those students getting to the end. The book is aimed at making that first draft into something worth believing in again.\nWireless Presenter (Logitech) No one who makes regular presentations should be without one of these.\nDatex Miracle cube timer Entertaining way of keeping track of time and working in short focused bursts.\nWake up light (Philips) To make getting out of bed and facing another day just a little bit easier.\nCoffee related products For example a new Moka pot with some packs of good coffee to go with it. Or a new coffee mug, this one caught my eye: http://www.cafepress.de/mf/22018626/dont-ask-a-phd_mugs?productId=123358260\nSo that brings us to the end of the first year of the Helmholtz Juniors blog. To those that have been following us, thank you for the support! To all those with the noses to the grindstone over the break, best of luck, may the end come soon but in the meantime, may the coffee flow and enjoy the time you have!\nMerry Christmas from all of us and a happy and successful New Year!\n","date":"2014-12-22T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2014/12/a-phd-christmas-tips-and-tricks/images/Merry-Christmas-HHJ_hu_232ee369fc8f6b4e.png","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2014/12/a-phd-christmas-tips-and-tricks/","title":"A PhD Christmas: Tips and tricks"},{"content":"Do you know this feeling? You go to your office every day, you work in your own little world, mostly on your own and at some point you start thinking: why do I do this? Who will profit from my work when it\u0026rsquo;s finished (if one day it will actually be finished)? Who will even read it? Will it really make the world a little bit better?\nWell, it happens to me every now and then. It\u0026rsquo;s not fun. Motivation drops, I can\u0026rsquo;t concentrate, I want to leave work immediately and do something really important that will save the world. In good moments I have thousands of ideas about what would be more useful than what I do now. In bad moments I\u0026rsquo;m completely lost and can\u0026rsquo;t think of anything that could possibly have a positive effect on anyone.\nThis is more or less the mood I was in when I left for the Alter-Net Summer School in Peyresq, Haute-de-Provence, France in September this year. And then, something wonderful happened: I spent 10 days with 30 other students and almost as many lecturers and tutors in a beautiful, picturesque little village in the Provence mountains, talking, discussing and listening to lectures about \u0026ldquo;Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services\u0026rdquo;. And these 10 days not only changed my so to speak professional point of view of the whole topic (with which my PhD topic is also related) but it also made me even more emotionally connected to it. The lectures and discussions were at times frightening or worrying, at times optimistic and always motivating and inspiring. I felt that with so many bright people (some already with lots of experience, some having just started) working on this huge problem of global habitat and biodiversity loss together we could actually make a change. I now feel connected and part of a bigger picture. I don\u0026rsquo;t feel alone with my work any more.\nThe lectures covered a wide variety of topics all connected to biodiversity and ecosystem services, giving us a broad picture. We got to know \u0026ldquo;A business perspective on biodiversity\u0026rdquo; (Timo Lehesvirta), talked about \u0026ldquo;The challenges of communicating science\u0026rdquo; in the media (Mary Colwell-Hector), learned about \u0026ldquo;Landscape variability and impacts of ammonia in relation to the Habitat Directive\u0026rdquo; (Mark Sutton) and discussed \u0026ldquo;A critical perspective on valuation\u0026rdquo; of ecosystem services (Erik Gomez). And this is just giving a few examples of the many lectures and discussions we had. We also worked on a mock EU-project on how to evaluate and sustainably manage the services provided by the ecosystems in the Verdon catchment area (which is the area where the little village we stayed in is located).\nBut apart from all the (very interesting) scientific content, what was most important and inspiring for me was to get in touch with people from all over the world, working on the same pressing problem in different fields and from different perspectives. I made great friends! By living together, eating together, drinking and dancing together at night, going for some hikes and walks in the area, watching the amazing stars in the night, through every morning\u0026rsquo;s yoga classes and a day-long excursion to see all the beautiful places in the area (Le Lac du Sainte Croix, the canyon, vultures, lavender fields, an organic goat farm), we really got to know each other quite well and we are already thinking about where and when to meet again.\nI think Summer Schools really give you the opportunity to view your topic from a wider perspective, to get new idea and to get in touch with people who work in the same research field. What\u0026rsquo;s more, most of the speakers included in their talks some reports about the \u0026ldquo;real working world\u0026rdquo; and their experiences. They were also very happy to share their experiences of and views on the work life in individual chats and to answer all the questions we had. So I think some of us ended up with a clearer idea of what we want to do after our PhDs, what we can expect when we start working and what is expected from us.\nSo I can only recommend to any PhD student to find out about opportunities to take part in a Summer or Winter school. maybe your research centre itself offers one. Or they give funding for their students to take part in these Summer Schools hosted by other institutions. Especially when you\u0026rsquo;re stuck with your work, getting out there, meeting other people and thinking outside your little office might really help! It did for me.\n","date":"2014-11-12T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2014/11/summer-schools/images/Peyresq_hu_d34c0de386380a3a.jpg","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2014/11/summer-schools/","title":"Summer Schools"},{"content":"When using internet search engines on the phrase “Life after PhD” you find (besides the oh so well-known and loved PhD comics by Jorge Cham) many blogs and personal webpages all dealing with life after PhD – but mostly focusing on the world outside of academia. You find pages like “From PhD to Life”, “Career advice and hope for graduate students” , “11 alternative careers for PhD students” , and so on and so forth. Several hits below, there is finally one link dealing with career advices if you want to stay in academia (1). How come? What makes many of us first choose a long and laborious education to then finally switch to something completely different?\nLet us think back to the time when we decided to go to University to study our dream profession. We were highly enthusiastic, our curiosity reaching from the deepest oceans out to space and our motivation was nothing less than learning how to cure world’s most threatening diseases or finding a solution to climate change induced environmental problems. Well, maybe a bit over the top, but I guess we all had our plans and dreams at the begin of our university education. And for many of us it was the idea of being an independent investigator and doing discovery- or hypothesis-driven research that attracted us towards doing a dissertation. And then, at some point sooner or later, we discover that an academic career is no ‘walk in the park’ at all.\nThe survey among Helmholtz PhD Students in 2009/2010 showed that only 9% want to go for a post doc position in Germany, the majority wants to switch to industry or go abroad (2). One of the main reasons is low salaries and the high amount of temporary contracts, which make life planning very difficult. In Germany 90% of the scientific staff has only a temporary contract; the majority of these contracts have a runtime of less than one year (3). A recent OECD study showed that five years after receiving their degrees, more than 60% of PhDs in Slovakia and more than 45% in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany and Spain were still on temporary contracts. Many of them were postdocs (4). In England, France or the United States on the other hand scientific careers besides the classical professorship are still customary. But looking closer at articles and blogs from US or British post docs, they as well report a worsening of working conditions. The most common points of critique are low salary, long working hours, little recognition and fierce competition.\nBut despite this questionable situation, today we have more PhDs worldwide than ever before. Between 1998 and 2006 the number of doctorates handed out in all OECD countries grew by 40% (4). The German statistical office reports that more than 200 000 dissertations were supervised in Germany during winter semester 2010/2011 (5). So obviously still many young people, more than ever before, initially accept suboptimal conditions because they want to do their dream job. But even if you accept harsh working conditions and low payment, the competition for academic positions is severe. For every available opening for a tenure-track professorship in the United States, there are roughly seven postdocs (4), and the situation in other countries might not be brighter.\nDevastated after reading all that? Don’t be. If you managed to do your PhD in Germany, maybe within the Helmholtz Association or in any other research institute or University, you are privileged! You own the privilege of belonging to the group of people that could choose and afford the education they love. And even if you should decide to leave academia - you are well educated and prepared for all the adventures and challenges that wait for you out there. And if you decide to stay in academia, the Helmholtz Association and other institutions in Germany offer funding to make the start easier. And most of these research fellowships are accessible for international students, too! Find below some info about the funding for early career scientists provided by the Helmholtz association and links to other institutions.\nSo let me end here with the famous advice from Douglas Adams (valid not only for PhD students ;-) Don’t Panic!\nThe Helmholtz Postdoc Programme “Promote Early Scientific Independence and Equal Opportunities“ What: To enable early career scientists to work independently on a research topic of their own choosing Who: German and international early career scientists Qualification: You have gained your doctoral qualification in Germany or abroad within the last year or are about to earn the degree Duration: Up to 3 years Application: A new call will be published in spring 2015\nHelmholtz Young Investigators Groups What: To allow young researchers to set up and lead their own research group Who: German and international early career scientists who want to continue their scientific career in Germany Condition: You have to work in cooperation with universities, and are given the chance to gain teaching experience and to acquire the qualifications necessary for a university career Qualification: The programme is aimed at young researchers who earned their doctorate about two to six years ago.

This blog is distillation of what I learnt. I came across a nice phrase which says \u0026quot; publish or perish \u0026ldquo;. The phrase nicely sums up the academic life of a researcher who is inevitably judged by the number and quality of his/her published paper. Before you start writing a scientific paper, there are few basic questions that you need to know. The questions are as following:\nWhy to publish?\nThe main motive behind publishing a scientific paper is to communicate your research, to make your work visible to the world. You may also want to publish your research as part of your quest for fame, fortune or for tenure.\nWhat to publish?\nThe hard and fast rule on the content of a publication is research should be absolutely reproducible. People following your research should have same results under the limit of statistical acceptable fluctuations.\nWho should publish?\nMost of the research comprises of a team including senior scientists, post-doctoral fellows, graduate students or technicians. The most senior member in the team owns the privilege of approving manuscripts and submits it to a journal.\nWhere to publish?\nA scientific research is always a follow up or extension of some previous published work. Therefore, you should know your target journal before you start writing. However, if your work is of broader interest then you might try to publish in Science, Nature, or the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (known as “PNAS”).\nSome of the skills required for research are also required for writing a scientific paper, for example, planning, organization and attentiveness, but for sure writing a paper also requires many additional skills. The difference in magnitude amplifies if your native language is not same in which you want to write paper. However, there are some common mistakes that scientists make when they write up their research for publication and if you take care of those mistakes then you can make life easier to some extent. Here, I tried to sum up all those common mistakes and how can they be avoided.\nNever ignore the instructions of the target journal to Authors. Every journal that is published supplies specific Instructions to Authors, follow them religiously. The language of manuscript (mostly English) should be grammatically correct and absolutely free of ambiguity. Maintain spelling consistency. For instance if you are targeting American journal then you should use American spelling of all words. If you are submitting your paper to British, Canadian, or European journal, you should use British spelling consistently. Be careful with the use of “that” and “which”. Compare the following sentences, “The cells grew in the enriched medium that contained calcium ions” and “The cells grew in the enriched medium, which contained calcium ions. “ The first sentence emphasizes on the “calcium medium” making it distinct from the other mediums. The second sentence emphasizes on that cells were able to grow in the enriched medium, sentence at the same time includes some additional information about the content of medium. “None” in a sentence means “not one” and it is singular. Abbreviations need to be written out in full form when they are mentioned first time. It is common practice to write numbers from one to ten as words (for example, write “one” for “1”) unless abbreviated units follow the number. For example, you should not write “three g/l”. The correct version is “3 g/l”. Use semi colons to separate items in complicated big sentences. For example, if you are making cake, you need the following ingredients: butter, preferably unsalted but salted can be used if unsalted not available; sugar either granulated or powdered; eggs, which should be fresh. As you can see, semicolons allow each description of ingredients to be separated. Be careful with the use of a participle (an “-ing” word, such as standing, running, and jumping). A participle should always relate to subject in the sentence. For example, use of incorrect related participle results in one such sentence, “The cells were grown in ABC medium containing glycine”. Here, subject in the sentence which is “The cells” doesn’t directly relate to glycine, therefore correct version will be “The cells were grown in ABC medium, which contained glycine”. Avoid using nouns as adjectives. “This” is often incorrect. For example, after a lengthy description of his results, a author might start a new sentence with “This showed ….. “ without specifically mentioning the observation. Therefore, it is necessary to start the sentence by referring to specific observation, for example, “The formation of cell clumps showed ….. “. The phrase “due to” can link only two nouns. It cannot be used as adverb. For example, it will be incorrect to say, “Due to the presence of an enzyme, we saw blue colonies”. The correct version will be , “The formation of blue colonies was due to presence of an enzyme in the cells.” Avoid using many fonts on the title page, choose simple and plain font, such as Helvetica, and use it for every item on your title page. Always use \u0026ldquo;briefly\u0026rdquo; instead of phrase \u0026ldquo;in brief\u0026rdquo;. Avoid inconsistent formatting in the body parts, for example, should the title have one capital M or two (\u0026rdquo; Material and Methods \u0026quot; or \u0026quot; Material and methods \u0026quot; )?, should the title be left or on the center aligned? etc. Pay attention to the punctuations in your reference list. Depending on the journal the range of punctuation combinations varies, for example, two authors can be listed simply as \u0026ldquo;Andrews AK and Mohr L\u0026rdquo; or as \u0026ldquo;Andrews, A.K., and Mohr, L.\u0026rdquo; and in some journals, an ampersand \u0026ldquo;\u0026amp;\u0026rdquo; replaces \u0026ldquo;and\u0026rdquo; to yield \u0026ldquo;Andrews, A.K., \u0026amp; Mohr L.\u0026rdquo; Graphs and histograms should always indicate standard deviations. Results should be related to the title of your paper and should be absolutely reproducible. Pay attention to organization of results, some journals encourage condensation of Results and Discussion into one section. The commonest mistake researchers make in the presentation of numerical data involving the number of significant figures and decimal places. Try limiting the number of digits after decimal to make number meaningful. I hope this blog helps a bit to all my peers, Cheers.\n","date":"2014-10-22T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2014/10/the-most-common-mistakes-in-scientific-writing/images/writinghardwork_hu_fe5a3add449b3e9f.jpg","permalink":"https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2014/10/the-most-common-mistakes-in-scientific-writing/","title":"The most common mistakes in scientific writing"},{"content":"Recently, we had the \u0026ldquo;Tag der Forschung\u0026rdquo; - our open day - at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht (HZG). It took place on a sunny Saturday even though rain was forecasted. Laboratories and other facilities were open to the public, there was a stage with live music and children could dress up as *real* scientists, participate in a research quiz and build particle detectors with Lego. I also built one (see picture 1). Also, some parents built their own ones. In one case the parents even wanted to stay longer than their child. All particle detectors can be found here: http://bit.ly/LEGO-HZG .\nWhy should we - researchers or future researchers - care about showing people what we are doing? An open day costs a lot of money and time which could have been invested in research instead. However, it brings research closer to people who do not have a connection to research in their everyday life. It shows for what purpose tax money is spent. It may motivate pupils to start studying subjects related to our work with the aim to go into research later. It offers people the opportunity to enter areas which are commonly restricted to research personal only. People have a nice day at our working place. It shows that researchers normally look quite normal.\nI was wondering what other Helmholtz Zentren do with respect to presenting their research to the public. They do quite a lot. Every second Helmholtz Zentrum had a open day within the last three years. At least HZB (Berlin), UFZ (Leipzig), GFZ (Potsdam), Desy (Hamburg) and HZG (Geesthacht/Hamburg) were active at \u0026ldquo;Nights of Knowledge\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Nights of Research\u0026rdquo;. Desy and DLR have their own magazines. Several Helmholtz Zentren or individuals working there have blogs on which they regularly post.\nThere are also two upcoming events. Perhaps you are close by and have time to take a look?\nOpen Day at the DLR (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt) in Oberpfaffenhofen, 12th October 2014: Open Day DLR Open Day at the DKFZ (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum) in Heidelberg, 19th October 2014: Open Day DKFZ What do I want to express with this blog entry?\nThe open day at HZG was a nice day and I got to know some colleagues which I did not know before. Open days, nights of knowledge and other similar events are important for representing our institutes and for transferring some basic knowledge to visitors. Take a look what people at other researchers do. Have a nice weekend :-) .

It was the second time we met this year after our first meeting at the Helmholtz Center Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) in January.\nIt is useful to mention here that the HeJu’s are not an official body of the Helmholtz Association, but a diverse group of volunteering PhD students who are committed to improve PhD working conditions and connect PhDs within the Helmholtz Association as well as within Germany (look at this map to see where we are located). This includes a cacophony of emails, phone calls, doodle lists, literature research and skype conferences. And all that we are trying to manage on the side to our own demanding PhD projects, of course.\nBut, I was really looking forward to the meeting as we had set ambitious goals back in January and our predecessors had informed us that it might be difficult to keep up the motivation for our projects throughout the entire year. Thus, we decided to get together again already after half a year to renew our HeJu energy.\nSo, there we were: One and a half days full of reports, heated discussions, brainstorming and coffee overflow. First of all our spokespersons Nicholas and Sripriya and our four working groups presented the progress so far. The main achievements have been the active participation in an update of the Helmholtz Association’s official PhD guidelines (which virtually has some effect on all Helmholtz PhD students), the finishing of our “Helmholtz PhD booklet” (we will keep you posted about this!) and the launch of this year’s PhD survey (where every PhD student under Helmholtz can actually help to improve the conditions, hopefully you all took part. But, don’t worry if not, it’s still possible until Sep 19th!!! Go for it!).\nThanks to our “events” group who was busy organizing this meeting we’ve been in close contact with officials of the Helmholtz Association and the direct feedback was helping a lot to shape common goals and to identify certain (im)possibilities. For instance, what financial support can we expect and what are the advantages and disadvantages of becoming an official body of the Helmholtz Association? A topic so fundamental, that the formation of a new working group was required to evaluate its pros and cons. But, a special treat for us was the visit of Prof. Dr. Jürgen Mlynek, president of the Helmholtz Association, who took some time to welcome us personally in the headquarter and also stayed for a quick Q\u0026amp;A session (see header). How much closer can you get as a PhD student to the very head of your research organization?\nDuring several sessions the individual working groups discussed and developed new ideas and eventually set the goals for the rest of the term. Furthermore, we were lucky to talk with the public relations officials, who gave us vital support on our visibility and communication structure as well as an insight into their day-to-day work. A result of which we have this brand new Blog you happened to be reading right now and the new HeJu’s logo.\nSo, what is left to do for this year? Of course, the discussion on the PhD guidelines is not over yet and will go on. One goal, for example, is to increase contract positions for PhDs in relation to scholarships. The “survey” group will have a busy time analyzing the survey results and wrapping that up until January next year, when the HeJu’s meet again at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven. The PhD booklet will be published and available for everyone who’s interested (some interviews with the people involved will be up as well). We are also planning a special event where PhD students can connect and get information on career options and this Blog will be filled with more articles about our work as HeJu’s and topics about PhD life in general.
