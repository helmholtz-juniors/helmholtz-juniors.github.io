&lt;p&gt;To all our dedicated doctoral researchers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, the Helmholtz Juniors, understand that our shared passion for science and research is accompanied by unique challenges, such as increased work load, mental stress, and potentially even power abuse. This survey serves as your platform to voice concerns and experiences related to supervision quality, power dynamics, and mental health status within your centers. By sharing your story, you are advocating for a healthier, more supportive academic environment for both yourself and your peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information as catalyst for change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your insights are invaluable in helping us to be at the forefront of championing positive changes within the academic system, no matter how gradual the progress may seem. The information you share with us through this survey serves as a beacon, guiding the improvement of doctoral programs worldwide. Your participation brings to light the realities of doctoral research, enabling stakeholders to address issues proactively. It&amp;rsquo;s through understanding your experiences that we can identify areas for improvement and advocate for a healthier academic ecosystem. This is your opportunity to be part of a transformative movement, leveraging information to carve out a better path for all doctoral researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking out for yourself and future doctoral researchers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking part, you are not just sharing your own experiences but also paving the way for a more supportive environment for those who follow. Our reports help visualize that many of the challenges you face are shared across the entire academic community of doctoral researchers, reinforcing the fact that you are not alone in your journey. This collective insight highlights common issues, underscoring the importance of a unified approach to advocacy and improvement. Together, we can build a legacy of resilience, support, and success, ensuring that the challenges of today become the lessons and victories of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why we do the survey every 2 years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistency is key to understanding and initiating lasting change. Conducting this survey biennially allows us to track progress, identify new challenges, and adapt strategies to meet the evolving needs of doctoral researchers. This regular pulse-check ensures that our efforts are not just reactive but proactive, keeping the well-being of doctoral researchers at the forefront of academic development. We are aware that change within academia can be slow, but by continually gathering your feedback, we aim to be steadfast advocates for positive evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigating challenges together&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcoming the delays and intricacies of German bureaucracy, particularly doing it side-by-side while pursuing doctorates, posed a significant challenge for us. The path to delivering this survey was fraught with hurdles that, at times, seemed insurmountable due to the complex nature of administrative processes we faced. However, the unwavering dedication and teamwork of key supporters within our community turned these potential roadblocks into milestones, ensuring your voices could be effectively heard. This journey underscored the power of unity and resilience, demonstrating that no obstacle is too daunting when we come together with a shared goal. Thank you to everyone who contributed, making this survey a reality and championing the cause of doctoral researchers across the Helmholtz Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you for your participation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your time, honesty, and courage in participating in this survey are immensely appreciated. Every response adds a vital piece to the puzzle, bringing us closer to an academic environment that cherishes and nurtures the mental health and well-being of its researchers. Thank you for lending your voice to this crucial cause. Together, we are stronger, and together, we can make a difference. Your input today is a step towards a more inclusive and nurturing academic tomorrow – take the survey now!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>It’s all about the data!</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2021/09/its-all-about-the-data/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2021/09/its-all-about-the-data/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2021/09/its-all-about-the-data/images/survey.png" alt="Featured image of post It’s all about the data!" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to research in sciences, it&amp;rsquo;s all about the data. We conduct experiments, questionnaires, fieldtrips, or models, spend many hours in the lab or in front of the computer, or whatever other way there is to gather data. From high-pressure/high-temperature experiments with just a handful of data points to big data cancer modelling– solid data is always the ground stone for our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why we, the Helmholtz Juniors, conduct a large, German-wide survey in cooperation with the Max-Planck PhDnet, IPP Mainz PhD Network and the Leibnitz PhD network every two years. This year, the TU Munich is also participating in the survey. Such a database enables us to change the working conditions of every doctoral researcher (DR) within the network or even in Germany in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why do we need every single DR to fill out the survey?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Helmholtz Juniors alone combine about 8,000 DRs under their name (as of 2017). Together with the other three PhD networks we form the network of networks – N², summing up to a total of about 16,000 doctoral researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year about 30% of the DRs participated, which means about 4,800 DRs filled out the whole survey. That’s quite good considering the sheer number of DRs, but still like a puzzle that’s not continued with many pieces missing just because you can see the bigger picture; a lot of details get lost in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s why this year, we have the goal of 50% participation rate: to see more detail, to allow statistical outliers become patterns, to make our analysis and interpretations even more underpinned than last surveys. But to achieve this, we need every opinion that there is, every possible outcome of the survey, every piece of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#RaceTo50&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s the topic?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last 1 ½ years were especially hard for all of us. No field work, no coffee with the colleagues, no chat about your ideas in the hallway, long waiting lists for analysis time, no networking with international colleagues on conferences, no barbeque with the newcomers, isolating conditions of home office, screwed up work-life-sleep balance, …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covid-19 did affect all of us, exacerbated worries that already existed and producing a cohort of worried DRs concerned about completion and quality of their work, worried about their career path and options, worried about their future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s survey will have a bunch of questions about your life and your work during the pandemic, impacts on social environment, navigation of a doctoral thesis, emotional, technological and logistical problems that came up and multiple other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the thing is, everyone of us had different problems. We do not see or hear everything. There are just too many factors that can change everything, too many variables, too many mutual dependent conditions. And that’s why we want to hear about your life adjustments, your problems, your ideas to amend the situation: to figure out typical phenomena, reoccurring patterns, intersecting sets of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And what’s the use of this effort?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This survey is indeed a huge effort. It takes a long time to prepare it (props to our Survey Team!) as well as to evaluate it – not considering the amount of time summing up all the 30 min of filling out a survey from thousands of participating DRs. So why do we stem all this work? Easy: to make a change!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past results have been featured in press conferences and published in journals, newspapers, blogs, and radio stations all over Germany and worldwide. Examples are the Tagesspiegel, Deutschlandfunk or the podcast SWR2 Wissen. A summary of the results was even published in Nature. These publications got us an invitation to the Bundestag as experts and meetings with the Federal Ministers of Education and Research (BMBF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means the problems of our DRs, your problems, get attention in the highest institutions of Germany and the scientific community in general. This fact is encouraging us to go forward with all the voices we can gather and change the world of young researchers for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But therefore, we need the data, we need all voices, we need your voice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
