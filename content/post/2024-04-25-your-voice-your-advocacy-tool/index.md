To all our dedicated doctoral researchers,

We, the Helmholtz Juniors, understand that our shared passion for science and research is accompanied by unique challenges, such as increased work load, mental stress, and potentially even power abuse. This survey serves as your platform to voice concerns and experiences related to supervision quality, power dynamics, and mental health status within your centers. By sharing your story, you are advocating for a healthier, more supportive academic environment for both yourself and your peers.

**Information as catalyst for change**

Your insights are invaluable in helping us to be at the forefront of championing positive changes within the academic system, no matter how gradual the progress may seem. The information you share with us through this survey serves as a beacon, guiding the improvement of doctoral programs worldwide. Your participation brings to light the realities of doctoral research, enabling stakeholders to address issues proactively. It's through understanding your experiences that we can identify areas for improvement and advocate for a healthier academic ecosystem. This is your opportunity to be part of a transformative movement, leveraging information to carve out a better path for all doctoral researchers.

**Looking out for yourself and future doctoral researchers**

By taking part, you are not just sharing your own experiences but also paving the way for a more supportive environment for those who follow. Our reports help visualize that many of the challenges you face are shared across the entire academic community of doctoral researchers, reinforcing the fact that you are not alone in your journey. This collective insight highlights common issues, underscoring the importance of a unified approach to advocacy and improvement. Together, we can build a legacy of resilience, support, and success, ensuring that the challenges of today become the lessons and victories of tomorrow.

**Why we do the survey every 2 years?**

Consistency is key to understanding and initiating lasting change. Conducting this survey biennially allows us to track progress, identify new challenges, and adapt strategies to meet the evolving needs of doctoral researchers. This regular pulse-check ensures that our efforts are not just reactive but proactive, keeping the well-being of doctoral researchers at the forefront of academic development. We are aware that change within academia can be slow, but by continually gathering your feedback, we aim to be steadfast advocates for positive evolution.

**Navigating challenges together**

Overcoming the delays and intricacies of German bureaucracy, particularly doing it side-by-side while pursuing doctorates, posed a significant challenge for us. The path to delivering this survey was fraught with hurdles that, at times, seemed insurmountable due to the complex nature of administrative processes we faced. However, the unwavering dedication and teamwork of key supporters within our community turned these potential roadblocks into milestones, ensuring your voices could be effectively heard. This journey underscored the power of unity and resilience, demonstrating that no obstacle is too daunting when we come together with a shared goal. Thank you to everyone who contributed, making this survey a reality and championing the cause of doctoral researchers across the Helmholtz Association.

**Thank you for your participation**

Every response adds a vital piece to the puzzle, bringing us closer to an academic environment that cherishes and nurtures the mental health and well-being of its researchers. Thank you for lending your voice to this crucial cause. Together, we are stronger, and together, we can make a difference. Your input today is a step towards a more inclusive and nurturing academic tomorrow – take the survey now!
