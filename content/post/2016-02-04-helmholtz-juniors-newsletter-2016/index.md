Almost a year has passed since the last Helmholtz Juniors meeting in Bremerhaven (see [here](http://blogs.helmholtz.de/hejus/2015/01/heju-annual-meeting-2015/)) and the 2016 meeting is casting its shadow (or more appropriate: its light). So time has come for recapitulating what we did during this year and also for some of us – for example me – it is time to hand over our ideas, visions and tasks to the ones that are joining the Helmholtz Juniors for 2016.

As this process of recapitulating is not meant to be exclusively for ourselves, the Helmholtz Juniors newsletter 2015 was written to give others the opportunity to see and read what we did.

When working on the newsletter, together with my fellow Communication Group mates I realized that it is quite a lot that has been achieved during the year and that some of these achievements may be the foundation for interesting developments in the near future.

I have to confess that I did not expect this conclusion. The work on my tasks in the Communication group always seemed to suffer from the PhD workload and resulting small amounts of time that I could invest in doing and organizing the tasks we agreed upon. But as I said before, sitting in my gloomy office and writing this lines (the office is not so gloomy actually) I have the feeling that we did a good job and I want to use this post as an opportunity to thank my fellow group mates and all the people that were working in the other Helmholtz Juniors groups for doing a great job.

If you doubt my words, have a look into our newsletter :)
