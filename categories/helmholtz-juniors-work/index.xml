&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recruiting top national and international talent is a major challenge in the highly competitive field of academic research and is of crucial importance to the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres (HGF). To succeed in the race for scientific progress, the HGF must offer attractive and reliable working conditions for its early-career researchers. In practice, however, individual contracts are predominantly concluded between the respective Helmholtz Centers and doctoral researchers, which reduces both the transparency of contract terms and the equal opportunity goals pursued by the HGF. As the voice of doctoral researchers within the HGF, the Helmholtz Juniors advocate for integrating all doctoral researchers employed at Helmholtz Centers into the collective agreement for the public sector (TVöD), pay grade E13. This is the only way to ensure fair and transparent working conditions and attract top-tier talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following outlines the advantages of collective agreements over individual contracts, often referred to as funding agreements. In contrast, scholarships typically fail to provide the necessary social security and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="collective-agreements-create-transparency"&gt;Collective Agreements Create Transparency
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science, as an international field of work, requires regulations that are transparent and understandable in an international context1. In a statement on the amendment of the Act on Temporary Scientific Contracts (WissZeitVG), the Alliance of Science Organisations in Germany warned against the risk of a confusing diversity of regulations and, in the worst case, disparities between institutions2. The Max Planck Society, for example, offers at least standardized (funding) contracts, whereas the HGF features a remarkable diversity of contracts for doctoral researchers. The most common type of contract in the HGF is individual, non-tariff agreements with durations of two to four years and compensation ranging from 55% to 100% of a full-time position. Only about a third of the centers apply the TVöD on an individual basis. Despite having an application agreement with the United Services Union (ver.di), two Helmholtz Centers effectively exclude doctoral researchers from the collective agreement by invoking § 1 para. 2 letter s of the TVöD. Two other centers are affiliated with universities due to their historical development and therefore apply the collective agreement for the public service of the federal states (TV-L), which uses a different pay scale. This inconsistent and arbitrary patchwork of rules not only prevents transparency but also creates inequalities among doctoral researchers within the HGF. This undermines equal opportunity and makes working conditions difficult to understand from an international perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="collective-agreements-ensure-equal-opportunity"&gt;Collective Agreements Ensure Equal Opportunity
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improving equal opportunity is a central priority in the HGF - this principle is firmly anchored in the HGF&amp;rsquo;s mission and is an integral part of its talent management3. Through their uniformity, collective agreements are an important tool that can significantly promote equal opportunity across the HGF. Collective agreements establish a standardized minimum framework that is regularly negotiated publicly and applies to all doctoral researchers. They ensure standardized regulations for working hours and vacation, recognize professional experience in compensation, and provide social security through additional benefits such as occupational pension schemes. In contrast, individual contracts can vary significantly in content and are subject to the unilateral stipulations of funding bodies, such as the Federal Ministry for Research, Technology and Space (BMFTR), formerly the Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF), which define only maximum standards - allowing individual institutes to make downward deviations at their discretion. This opens the door to potential misuse and disadvantages for individual doctoral researchers. With collective bargaining, any changes to the agreement are automatically applied to all employment contracts. In contrast, individual contracts only reflect new rules in newly signed agreements. Thus, collective agreements ensure full transparency and lay the foundation for equal opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="collective-agreements-increase-attractiveness-and-satisfaction"&gt;Collective Agreements Increase Attractiveness and Satisfaction
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sustainable and fair working conditions are not only key to long-term viability but also decisive for the lasting attractiveness and success of research institutions in an increasingly competitive academic landscape - a principle the Helmholtz Association already established in its 2016 sustainability management guidelines (LeNa). These guidelines emphasized the importance of developing new career paths and avoiding precarious employment, particularly for early-career researchers&lt;a class="link" href="#_ftn2" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;4&lt;a class="link" href="#_ftn2" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Competitive working conditions are the basis for attracting and retaining talented young scientists from both national and international backgrounds5,6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2020 study found that good working conditions and career prospects are key drivers of innovation in academic research7. Establishing good working conditions has twofold benefits: on the one hand, secure employment leads to higher satisfaction and productivity&lt;a class="link" href="#_ftn4" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;8&lt;a class="link" href="#_ftn4" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;; on the other hand, it enhances the employer’s appeal to international top talent. Job satisfaction is therefore a critical factor in the attractiveness of the public science sector. By introducing transparent, uniform contracts based on binding institutional application of the TVöD for doctoral researchers, the HGF can offer its early-career researchers sustainable, fair, and favorable working conditions - ensuring the retention of young talent amid a shortage of skilled workers in the public research sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="collective-agreements-reduce-bureaucracy"&gt;Collective Agreements Reduce Bureaucracy
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2023 inflation compensation payment demonstrated that the diversity of contract types results in increased administrative workload and uncertainty among doctoral researchers. Introducing the collective agreement for all doctoral researchers would simplify administrative processes and create independence from the directives of funding bodies such as the BMFTR, since collective bargaining law overrides ministerial guidelines and authorizations. This benefits both researchers and administrative staff, fosters a coherent and efficient organizational structure, enhances transparency, and strengthens the Helmholtz Centers&amp;rsquo; appeal as employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we emphasize that the binding institutional application of the TVöD without exception for all doctoral researchers at all Helmholtz Centers is a necessary measure. It aligns with the interests of the HGF by increasing its competitiveness in recruiting national and international talent, ensuring high satisfaction and productivity among researchers, promoting equal opportunity, and simplifying administrative processes. By supporting this initiative, the HGF can further strengthen its position as a leading actor in research and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Helmholtz Juniors represent around 8,000 doctoral researchers within the Helmholtz Association. They advocate for the introduction of collective agreements for doctoral researchers across the entire Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres. This position was unanimously adopted at the Helmholtz Juniors Annual Meeting in 2024.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open communication is key for a good working environment, effective collaboration, and a healthy relationship with your co-workers and supervisors. The ability to communicate well is crucial for working efficiently and successfully- especially during a doctorate. It is well known that a doctorate comes with a multitude of challenges unrelated to the actual research itself. Young researchers often face problems that are not only related to completely neutral working topics but are also on a personal level, which brings emotions into the mix. This includes problems with co-workers and quite often with the supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being emotionally involved makes it more challenging to communicate issues effectively and in a constructive manner. The real problem then is often not the actual problem, but rather the stimulated emotions. To make matters worse, communicating feelings at work is still sometimes perceived as unprofessional, weak, and inappropriate when precisely the opposite is true. Good communication is essential for maintaining not only a healthy working environment, but also good mental health and a free mind. In addition, learning how to communicate effectively leads to both personal and interpersonal growth. So, &lt;strong&gt;what IS the best way to communicate your problems and how it makes you feel?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is no one single solution for all problems, here are some general pointers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before reacting impulsively with strong emotions, take a deep breath and try to distance yourself from the situation. Practice some self-awareness. What is it that you are feeling? Understand your own emotions, so you can express yourself more clearly. Depending on the situation, it might be helpful to talk to a trusted friend or colleague about the circumstances. Maybe write down what the problem is and how it makes you feel. Where did this problem originate, and do you have a solution you could propose? Do you think you can solve the problem by yourself? If not, don’t hesitate to tackle the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When addressing problems, remember: the time and place matter. Choose a moment when both parties are receptive. Talk somewhere where you will not be interrupted or disturbed. Both parties should take the time needed to discuss with no time limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When communicating your problems, try to be as clear and specific as possible. Explain your problems and interests and if possible, give concrete examples. This helps the other party understand the issue and makes the issue tangible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People tend to quickly feel attacked, therefore when talking about the problem, use “I-statements”. Employ phrases such as “This gives me the feeling&amp;hellip;” or “This gives me the impression&amp;hellip;” and avoid direct confrontations like “You are&amp;hellip;” or “You always do XYZ&amp;hellip;”. Criticism in any situation should remain constructive. By staying with your emotions, it shifts the focus to your feelings and promotes empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to express how a problem is affecting &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, how it makes &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; feel. This more constructive than blaming or attacking the other person directly, which should be avoided. Direct criticism of a person can hurt the other party, incite retaliation, and create even more problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different points of view for every problem. The main goal is for all parties to understand each others’ points of view. This can help deescalate the situation and hopefully lead to a resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to the other party and allow them to answer without interruption. Keep in mind that their feelings are also valid. Try to understand their point of view and listen to their interests. If the situation becomes emotional, make sure to stay calm and respectful to foster a more positive outcome. Be open to apologizing when needed or appropriate. Maybe the other party did react out of emotions as well and both of you can approach each other. Try to stay in the present with a focus on the future. Do not be too hung up on the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are often dependencies in a working environment which you cannot easily dissolve or also do not intend to. That is why it is important to seek for a solution together which is suitable for all parties. Try to find areas of agreement upon which you can build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use expressions such as: “I feel like we are stuck, and I understand that the underlying reasons could be this and this. I would need a more supportive collaboration, and therefore I would appreciate X and Y. Of course, I want to support you on the same level. What would you need? How can we improve the situation?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After communicating your problem, take some time and reflect on the situation and on what was discussed. Keep up the communication to ensure progress in resolving the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel that the communication barrier is too high, involving a mediator can be a good idea. This can be a supervisor, but also an ombudsperson. Companies and institutes do often have persons specially trained in helping handle and resolve such situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, in some working environments, communicating your problems as a female comes with even more challenges such as being perceived as weak, and when speaking up, pushy. Here, it is important to not let yourself be silenced. If you face unjust criticism, stay consistent, stay strong. Such reactions say more about them and their inability to interface with strong women and less about you. In such situations it might be helpful to speak up and clearly reject such statements. Do not tolerate sexism at any point. Females communicating problems in a constructive, calm manner should not be subject to being called “tough” and “pushy” and being told to get out of their “victim-hood”. This is a failure in communication by the other party, and we suggest asking for a mediator or talking to a supervisor. Do not, however, let it stop you from communicating your problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, communication styles differ from culture to culture. While Germans tend to have a very direct way of communication, this is different in other cultures. The German way of communication can be perceived as impolite or offensive. However, in some cultures, silence is a strong form of communication, which can be missed if one is unaware of such culture-specific cues. These cultural differences should always be kept in mind and considered, especially in our very international work environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Quo vadis academic, when the contract expires?</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2024/02/quo-vadis-academic-when-the-contract-expires/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2024/02/quo-vadis-academic-when-the-contract-expires/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2024/02/quo-vadis-academic-when-the-contract-expires/images/Joingt-Statment-WissZeitVG-170323-5.png" alt="Featured image of post Quo vadis academic, when the contract expires?" /&gt;&lt;h4 id="wisszeitvg-commentary"&gt;WissZeitVG Commentary
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h5 id="a-guest-entry-by-johannes-krämer-heju-spokesperson-2023"&gt;&lt;em&gt;a guest entry by Johannes Krämer (HeJu Spokesperson 2023)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the state of freedom of science and academia today? The idea of academic freedom dates back long ago, and in short, ascertains that academics can conduct and communicate their research or teach without the fear of repression, job loss, or imprisonment. However, job security and career perspectives have been found to be among the biggest drawbacks of scientific careers in Germany [1]. One important tool to regulate this within the German academic system is the &lt;em&gt;Act on Fixed Term Employment Contracts in Academia&lt;/em&gt; (WissenschaftsZeitVertragsGesetz - WissZeitVG) [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WissZeitVG regulates fixed term contracts. More precisely, it regulates the maximal duration one is allowed to be employed on a fixed term contract in academia. It does not regulate working hours, salaries, vacation days, etc. neither does it explicitly address working conditions, supervision of doctoral researchers, or project funding resources. It does not even regulate extensions, except defining an upper limit for the summed up contract time on fixed term contracts. So what&amp;rsquo;s all the fuss about if it&amp;rsquo;s “only about fixed-term contracts”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the WissZeitVG mainly regulates maximum contract duration, this regulation causes far-reaching consequences for the academic environment. It impacts the structure of research institutions, where a professor and a handful of researchers reside in those limited permanent positions, whereas a large number of postdoctoral researchers, staff scientists, lecturers, and doctoral researchers – the ones, who are performing major parts of the scientific and higher educational work – are employed with fixed term contracts. And yes, for doctoral researchers, this is easily comprehensible, since they work towards a clearly defined qualification goal in order to graduate and then move on to a new chapter of their career. But for postdoctoral researchers, no such clear qualification exists, and they simply gain experience in their field of work, hoping to land one of those rare permanent positions. But it’s not just the structure of working groups, departments, or institutes, the funding system is also tailored to the current constraints given by the WissZeitVG. If these were now changed and all fixed-term contracts for postdoctoral researches were removed instantaneously, this would result in a collapse of the system. There are not enough permanent positions available nowadays and no additional funds to increase these numbers. The other extreme – allowing only unlimited fixed-term contracts in academia – would risk that highly skilled employees remain in uncertainty for their whole working life, always in fear of losing their job and either need to relocate far away from their homes or not finding new employment due to being overqualified. Aspects that can have a negative impact on their productivity and well-being. These and many more aspects need to be taken into account, when discussing the WissZeitVG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evaluation of the WissZeitVG, published in 2022, has shown the need of an amendment to prevent precarious working conditions in academia [3]. Details on the poor functions and precarious conditions in the current system can also be found in the 2021 National Report on Junior Scholars (BuWiN) [4]. Too many chain contracts, the majority of people on fixed-term contracts, and over 85 % leaving academia within 10 years after graduation of their doctorate. The constant fear of losing one’s job or not being able to get a subsequent contract. Not being able to plan one’s career in the long term without depending on fortunate circumstances. Sinking into work in order to perform best in the next evaluation, and putting in countless hours of unpaid overtime to do so. All this makes academia a precarious field of work. Seeing that many doctoral researches still have the ambition to pursue an academic career [5], is at odds with the number of positions available. However, it also shows that researchers are genuinely eager to contribute to science and thus to the benefit of society**.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WissZeitVG needs to give prospects for those who stay in academia, “permanency” on fixed-term contracts may not be the answer to that. Making an academic career more predictable may make it more attractive to those groups, which are currently underrepresented. Females, first-gen academics, and all of those who cannot take the risk to spend many years in precarious conditions or who do not have the financial protection to bridge the time between contracts. On the other hand, leaving academia in a shorter period of time after graduation can be beneficial to proceed with a career outside of academia and gain required experiences there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were able to resolve all questions around the WissZeitVG in a blog post, the ongoing political process of the amendment of the act would not have been as tedious as it is. Finding solutions to problems arising in complex systems is not an easy task: and academia with its heterogeneity is a very complex system indeed. Here, we can only try to illustrate some aspects related to the topic, which might help to find a common ground for further discussions on the law itself. More detailed information on the position of HeJu and other doctoral researcher networks, as well as many other employee representations and unions who came together in a strong alliance can be found in our joint statement [6].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how the new amendment of the WissZeitVG will look like, it can only set the direction for what the academic environment will look like in the future. Many more steps have to be taken. The funding scheme needs to be adjusted accordingly. If fixed-term contracts are allowed for shorter periods, we need more permanent positions, thus, more funding for these types of positions is needed. Since it is unlikely that the total amount of money available for academia will grow strongly as funding remains limited, we need to optimize the selection of people for permanent positions, and accompany them during their careers, starting when they are already students and doctoral researchers. Other options, like the utilization of the regular fixed-term contract act (Teilzeit- und Befristungsgesetz, TzB) for postdoctoral researchers may be taken into account, in particular when being equipped with exceptional conditions as in the case of young investigator group leaders or similar positions. We might even need to reconsider how “&lt;em&gt;permanent”&lt;/em&gt; permanent positions will be. A permanent contract in academia will no longer be understood as a contract for the entire working life. Changing jobs within academia, since permanent positions are no longer the rare win in the lottery, will become normal. Breaking the one-way job transitions from academia to industry - but (almost) never &lt;em&gt;vice versa -&lt;/em&gt; will lead to a more dynamic setting where people change jobs and contribute a broader range of skills. Academia will be benefiting if it adapts to the new rules. In times of skilled workers shortage, we cannot risk losing the best educated. And we need to provide attractive conditions for internationals to shift the brain drain into a brain gain, which will eventually benefit many more areas beside the academic field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, no solution will meet all demands of all stakeholders, but we should not be afraid of substantial changes, if we want to truly improve the working conditions in academia. We shouldn’t make ill-advised decisions, and every possible adjustment of the WissZeitVG opens even more questions, which might need to be answered. Politicians have taken serious efforts to find a solution, which meets the expectations of employers and employees alike. We hope that they will continue to discuss with representatives of doctoral researchers, and listen to their advice as well as to the consultation of other parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last point to keep in mind: The doctoral researchers, as well as Bachelor and Master students of today, are the first generation affected by the amendment of the WissZeitVG. They might be inexperienced in questions of funding schemes and contract details, but they know best how it feels to look into their own future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s create a bright future for those bright minds, so that their academic endeavors are free again and not overshadowed by the fear of the extension.&lt;/p&gt;

Plädoyer für eine Reform des Befristungsrechts - ein gemeinsames Statement
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Die Wissenschaft in Deutschland ist in einer Krise und merkt es nicht. Es ist eine Krise des verschwendeten Potenzials ‒ eine Krise, die auf Kosten derjenigen ausgetragen wird, die das System maßgeblich tragen: der Wissenschaftler:innen ohne Professur. Unsicherheit und Zukunftsängste, Stress und zugespitzte Abhängigkeitsverhältnisse prägen den Alltag von Wissenschaft als Beruf. Obwohl inzwischen der Großteil von Forschung und Lehre von Wissenschaftler:innen ohne Professur gestemmt wird, sind verlässliche Arbeitsverhältnisse und berechenbare Perspektiven in der Regel nur für Professor:innen vorgesehen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wie produktiv könnte unsere Wissenschaft sein, wenn sie das Potenzial, das in unserem wissenschaftlichen Personal steckt, voll heben würde?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wissenschaft ist nicht zuletzt Denkarbeit, Experimentieren und kritisches Hinterfragen. Doch das braucht Zeit ‒ und lässt sich mit Hektik und Zukunftsangst nur unter Qualitätsverlusten und Selbstausbeutung verbinden. Die Eigenheiten des akademischen Karriereweges betreffen dabei nicht alle gleich. Nach wie vor haben Machtverhältnisse anhand von Faktoren wie race, class, gender und abilty einen prägenden Einfluss auf Zugänge, Berufswege und Karrierechancen in der Wissenschaft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Arbeitsverhältnisse der Promovierenden und Postdocs werden heute überwiegend nach dem Wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetz (WissZeitVG) geregelt. Dieses Gesetz wurde 2016 novelliert und der Einfluss dieser Novelle auf die Arbeitsverhältnisse in mehreren (im letzten Monat) publizierten Studien untersucht. Die Ergebnisse sind ernüchternd: Eine Trendwende hin zu mehr unbefristeten Arbeitsverhältnissen ist ausgeblieben, der Anteil der Kurzzeitverträge mit Laufzeiten von einem Jahr oder weniger wurde nicht nachhaltig reduziert. Qualifikationszeiten sind von den Vertragslaufzeiten nicht annähernd gedeckt. Die Instrumente des Nachteilsausgleichs entfalten keine verlässliche Wirkung. Die unterzeichnenden Organisationen sind deshalb überzeugt, dass jetzt eine mutige und grundlegende Reform des Sonderbefristungsrechts für die Wissenschaft notwendig ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eckpunkte für mehr Planbarkeit und Chancengleichheit der Berufswege in der Wissenschaft:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Der Qualifizierungsbegriff im WissZeitVG muss eng geführt und juristisch bindend definiert werden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eine Anstellung zur Promotion kann eine Befristung begründen. Für andere Qualifizierungsziele als Begründung für eine befristete Beschäftigung sehen wir in dieser Phase keine Berechtigung.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mit dem Eintritt in die Postdoc-Phase sollte in der Regel ein unbefristeter Arbeitsvertrag oder zumindest ein planbares Verfahren zur Entfristung in der Wissenschaft verbunden sein. Beschäftigte, deren Arbeit von Daueraufgaben geprägt ist, müssen auf Dauerstellen beschäftigt werden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vertragslaufzeiten müssen den angestrebten Qualifikationszielen entsprechen. Wie die Evaluationen eindrucksvoll zeigen, ist dies nicht der Fall: Mittlere effektive Vertragslaufzeiten bei Promovierenden von etwa 20 Monaten bei einer durchschnittlichen Promotionszeit von 4,7 Jahren (vgl. Bundesbericht Wissenschaftlicher Nachwuchs 2021) zeigen, dass die WissZeitVG-Novelle von 2016, an ihren eigenen Zielen gemessen, gescheitert ist. Die durchschnittlichen Qualifizierungszeiten sollten daher fächerspezifisch regelmäßig erhoben werden, um auf dieser Grundlage verbindliche Vorgaben zu machen. Unverbindliche Gesetzesformulierungen sind offenkundig nicht ausreichend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verlängerungen der Höchstbefristungsdauer (§ 2 Absatz 1 Sätze 4-6 WissZeitVG) führen, wie die Evaluation gezeigt hat, bisher kaum zu faktischen Vertragsverlängerungen und sollten als Rechtsansprüche der Beschäftigten neu ausgestaltet werden. Verlängerungsansprüche sollten hierbei für alle Beschäftigten zugänglich sein, die mit dem Ziel angestellt werden, eine Qualifizierung zu absolvieren.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Die Tarifsperre muss aufgehoben werden. Nur beim Thema Befristung in der Wissenschaft ist den Sozialpartnern durch das Arbeitsrecht verboten, wesentliche Fragen der Arbeitsbedingungen tariflich zu regeln. Dies steht im eklatanten Widerspruch zum im Koalitionsvertrag verankerten Ziel der Bundesregierung, die Tarifautonomie zu stärken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Das deutsche Wissenschaftssystem ist in einer solchen Krise, scheint es jedoch nicht zu merken. Es ist eine Krise des verschwendeten Potenzials, eine Krise, die auf Kosten derjenigen ausgetragen wird, die das System tragen. Die Wissenschaft in Deutschland erscheint nach außen kontinuierlich und verlässlich, aber hinter dieser Fassade sind die Probleme gravierend. So leiden etwa Promovierende überproportional häufig an depressiven Symptomen (unsere Studien: &lt;a class="link" href="https://leibniz-phd.net/survey-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Leibniz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz.de/karriere/karriere-bei-helmholtz/promovierende/helmholtz-juniors/survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Helmholtz&lt;/a&gt; und &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.phdnet.mpg.de/145345/2_PhDnet_Survey_Report_2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Max-Planck&lt;/a&gt;). Diese Promovierenden sind das unbestrittene Rückgrat des deutschen Wissenschaftssystems. Auch bilden  sie zusammen mit den Postdocs die Mehrheit des wissenschaftlichen Personals. Trotzdem werden ihre Bedürfnisse, Sorgen und Ängste vergleichsweise wenig bei der Gestaltung der Strukturen und Organisationskultur in der Wissenschaft berücksichtigt. So bleibt viel Potenzial ungenutzt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wie produktiv könnte unsere Forschung sein, wenn das System seinem wissenschaftlichen Personal ein angemessenes Arbeitsumfeld bieten würde? Wie viel Potenzial könnte dann ausgeschöpft werden?&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wissenschaft ist in erster Linie harte Denkarbeit. Doch insbesondere das Denken wird negativ von Unsicherheit und Zukunftsängsten beeinflusst. Die Arbeitsverhältnisse der Promovierenden und Postdocs werden heutzutage überwiegend nach dem WissZeitVG geregelt -einem Gesetz, das die Rahmenbedingung für die Befristung der Arbeitsverhältnisse von Wissenschaftlern gestalten soll. 2016 wurde dieses Gesetz novelliert und heute wurde die Evaluation dieser Novelle publiziert (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bmbf.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/de/2022/abschlussbericht-evaluation-wisszeitvg.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;amp;v=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Evaluationsbericht&lt;/a&gt;). Die primäre Begründung für die Befristung im WissZeitVG ist die “Qualifikation”, ein Begriff der jedoch juristisch nicht näher definiert ist. Das ist auch schon das Kernproblem dieses Gesetzes. Die meisten Einrichtungen (56.8%) haben keinerlei Leitlinien für Qualifizierungsziele entwickelt (Abb. 10 des Evaluationsberichts). Dass die Promotion eine Qualifikationsphase ist, halten wir für unbestreitbar. Doch schon in der Postdoc-Phase ist dies schwieriger zu definieren. In den meisten Fällen wird darum auf die Habilitation als Begründung zurückgegriffen (56%, Tab. 13 des Evaluationsberichts). In Anbetracht der Tatsache, dass die wenigsten von ihnen eine Professur erhalten können (max. 3% der Postdocs), erscheint dies jedoch absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das primäre Ziel der Novellierung des WissZeitVG 2016 war es “unsachgemäße Kurzbefristungen” zu unterbinden und verlässliche Rahmenbedingungen für die Befristungen von Arbeitsverträgen zu schaffen. Dieses Ziel wurde leider nicht erreicht. Nach einer kurzfristigen Verlängerung der mittleren effektiven Vertragslaufzeiten (durchschnittlichen Vertragslaufzeiten) von 2015 bis 2017, sind diese von 2017 bis 2020 auf den Vornovellierungs-Zustand zurückgefallen. Im Fall des promovierten Personals der AuF (Außeruniversitäre Forschungseinrichtungen) und HAW (Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaften), sind im Zeitraum zwischen 2015 und 2020 die mittleren eff. Vertragslaufzeiten sogar zurückgegangen (Abb. 1). Die vereinbarten Vertragslaufzeiten sind auch für die Promovierenden nicht angemessen. Die mittleren effektiven Laufzeiten liegen Organisationsübergreifend bei etwa 20 Monaten, wobei die Durchschnittliche Dauer einer Promotion in Deutschland 4.7 Jahre, also 55 Monate, beträgt (&lt;a class="link" href="https://buwin.de/dateien/buwin-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Buwin&lt;/a&gt;; Abb. B46). Insgesamt zeigt diese Evaluation, dass die unsachgemäße Befristungsdauer von Arbeitsverträgen nach wie vor die Norm in der Wissenschaft ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogs.helmholtz.de/hejus/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2022/05/Layout-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Abb. 1 - Mittlere effektive Vertragslaufzeiten des nach WissZeitVG angestellten Personals. Die Daten wurden aus den Tabellen 9-12 entnommen.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projektlaufzeiten von Drittmittelprojekten sind im Allgemeinen wesentlich länger als die entsprechenden Arbeitsverträge (Abb. 58 des Evaluationsberichts). Damit gehen die Arbeitgeber nicht ihrer Verpflichtung nach, die ihnen nach WissZeitVG §2 Absatz 2  auferlegt wird, denn dort heißt es, die “&lt;/p&gt;
\[...\]&lt;p&gt; vereinbarte Befristungsdauer soll dem bewilligten Projektzeitraum entsprechen”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diese schlecht planbaren und unsicheren Arbeitsbedingungen führen zu Zukunftssorgen, Selbstausbeutung und in der Konsequenz zu psychischen Belastungen für Promovierende wie Postdocs. Viele kluge Köpfe verlassen in der Folge die Wissenschaft und nehmen ihre Ideen und Methoden mit. Diese Lücken werden sich bemerkbar machen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welches Potential steckt also in unseren wissenschaftlichen Institutionen? Wir wissen es nicht! Für gute Forschung müssen gute Grundlagen geschaffen werden. Im Anbetracht der Schwierigkeiten, die uns im 21sten Jahrhundert beschäftigen werden und schon jetzt beschäftigen, brauchen wir den bestmöglichen wissenschaftlichen Apparat. Dieser fängt beim wissenschaftlichen Personal und dessen Arbeitsbedingungen an.&lt;/p&gt;

The German scientific system is in such a crisis but does not seem to recognize it. It’s a crisis of wasted potential, a crisis to the detriment of those who help to carry the system. From the outside, science in Germany appears to be continuous and reliable, but this façade only hides serious problems. For example, Doctoral Researchers (henceforth DRs) disproportionately often suffer from depressive symptoms (our studies: &lt;a class="link" href="https://leibniz-phd.net/survey-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Leibniz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz.de/karriere/karriere-bei-helmholtz/promovierende/helmholtz-juniors/survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Helmholtz&lt;/a&gt; und &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.phdnet.mpg.de/145345/2_PhDnet_Survey_Report_2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Max-Planck&lt;/a&gt;). These DRs are the undisputed backbone of the German scientific system. Moreover, together with Postdocs, they compose the majority of scientific staff. Nonetheless, their needs, worries and fears find comparatively little consideration when it comes to the design of structures and organizational culture in science. This way, a lot of potential remains unused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How productive could our research be if the system granted its scientific staff an adequate working environment? How much potential could we utilize?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science is primarily mental work. But especially mental capacities are negatively impacted by uncertainty and anxiety about the future. Currently and in most cases, the working conditions of DRs and Postdocs are regulated by the WissZeitVG -a law that is meant to set the general framework for scientists’ temporary employment conditions. In 2016, this law was amended and today the evaluation of this amendment has been published (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bmbf.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/de/2022/abschlussbericht-evaluation-wisszeitvg.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;amp;v=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;evaluation report&lt;/a&gt;). The primary justification for any temporary contract according to the WissZeitVG is “qualification”, a term which is, however, legally not closer defined. And that’s already this law’s core issue. Most institutions (56.8%) have not developed any guidelines for qualification goals (Figure 10 of the evaluation report). We do not doubt that the time of doing a doctorate is a qualification phase. However, when scientists enter the Postdoc phase, it is already more difficult to define the qualification goals.  For that matter, in most cases, habilitation is used as justification (56%, Table 13 of the evaluation report). This appears absurd considering that only a minority of those scientists can receive a professorship (max. 3% of Postdocs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary goal of the WissZeitVG 2016 amendment was to prohibit “inappropriate short-term contracts” and to create a reliable framework for the limitation of work contracts. Unfortunately, this goal has not been reached. After a brief period of time (2015 - 2017), in which average effective contract durations became longer, there appeared to be a relapse from 2017 to 2020 such that contract durations went back to the same level that was observed prior to the amendment. In case of PhD staff of non-academic science organizations (AuF) and of the university of applied sciences (HAW), average contract durations even decreased from 2015 to 2020 (Figure 1). The stipulated contract durations are not appropriate for DRs either. In their case, average effective contract durations are at 20 months regardless of the organization, even though the average doctoral research project actually takes 4.7 years, thus 55 months, in Germany (&lt;a class="link" href="https://buwin.de/dateien/buwin-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Buwin&lt;/a&gt;; Abb. B46). In sum, this evaluation depicts that inappropriate short-term contracts are still the norm in science.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durations of projects financed through third parties usually are longer than the respective work contracts (Figure 58 of the evaluation report). Therefore, employers are not fulfilling their duty, which is specified in WissZeitVG §2 Passage 2, where it says that the &amp;ldquo;[&amp;hellip;] stipulated contract duration shall correspond to the project duration&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These poorly projectable and uncertain working conditions lead to anxiety about the future, self-exploitation and, eventually, to psychological stress for DRs and Postdocs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequence is that many clever minds are leaving science, taking their ideas and methods with them. The holes they leave behind will become noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which potential is hiding in our scientific institutions? We don’t know! To allow for good research, a good foundation needs to be set. In light of the challenges, which will concern us in the 21st century, and already concern us, we need the best possible scientific apparatus. This starts with the scientific staff and their working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-author: Jacob L. Gorenflos López (FMP Berlin and advisory board member of the WissZeitVG evaluation)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>It’s all about the data!</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2021/09/its-all-about-the-data/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2021/09/its-all-about-the-data/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2021/09/its-all-about-the-data/images/survey.png" alt="Featured image of post It’s all about the data!" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to research in sciences, it&amp;rsquo;s all about the data. We conduct experiments, questionnaires, fieldtrips, or models, spend many hours in the lab or in front of the computer, or whatever other way there is to gather data. From high-pressure/high-temperature experiments with just a handful of data points to big data cancer modelling– solid data is always the ground stone for our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why we, the Helmholtz Juniors, conduct a large, German-wide survey in cooperation with the Max-Planck PhDnet, IPP Mainz PhD Network and the Leibnitz PhD network every two years. This year, the TU Munich is also participating in the survey. Such a database enables us to change the working conditions of every doctoral researcher (DR) within the network or even in Germany in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why do we need every single DR to fill out the survey?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Helmholtz Juniors alone combine about 8,000 DRs under their name (as of 2017). Together with the other three PhD networks we form the network of networks – N², summing up to a total of about 16,000 doctoral researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year about 30% of the DRs participated, which means about 4,800 DRs filled out the whole survey. That’s quite good considering the sheer number of DRs, but still like a puzzle that’s not continued with many pieces missing just because you can see the bigger picture; a lot of details get lost in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s why this year, we have the goal of 50% participation rate: to see more detail, to allow statistical outliers become patterns, to make our analysis and interpretations even more underpinned than last surveys. But to achieve this, we need every opinion that there is, every possible outcome of the survey, every piece of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#RaceTo50&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s the topic?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last 1 ½ years were especially hard for all of us. No field work, no coffee with the colleagues, no chat about your ideas in the hallway, long waiting lists for analysis time, no networking with international colleagues on conferences, no barbeque with the newcomers, isolating conditions of home office, screwed up work-life-sleep balance, …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covid-19 did affect all of us, exacerbated worries that already existed and producing a cohort of worried DRs concerned about completion and quality of their work, worried about their career path and options, worried about their future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s survey will have a bunch of questions about your life and your work during the pandemic, impacts on social environment, navigation of a doctoral thesis, emotional, technological and logistical problems that came up and multiple other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the thing is, everyone of us had different problems. We do not see or hear everything. There are just too many factors that can change everything, too many variables, too many mutual dependent conditions. And that’s why we want to hear about your life adjustments, your problems, your ideas to amend the situation: to figure out typical phenomena, reoccurring patterns, intersecting sets of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And what’s the use of this effort?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This survey is indeed a huge effort. It takes a long time to prepare it (props to our Survey Team!) as well as to evaluate it – not considering the amount of time summing up all the 30 min of filling out a survey from thousands of participating DRs. So why do we stem all this work? Easy: to make a change!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past results have been featured in press conferences and published in journals, newspapers, blogs, and radio stations all over Germany and worldwide. Examples are the Tagesspiegel, Deutschlandfunk or the podcast SWR2 Wissen. A summary of the results was even published in Nature. These publications got us an invitation to the Bundestag as experts and meetings with the Federal Ministers of Education and Research (BMBF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means the problems of our DRs, your problems, get attention in the highest institutions of Germany and the scientific community in general. This fact is encouraging us to go forward with all the voices we can gather and change the world of young researchers for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But therefore, we need the data, we need all voices, we need your voice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Check out the interview (4/5) here!

Our HeJu survey team explains you the motivation and execution of our 2019 HeJu survey" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a doctoral researcher (DR) can sometimes lead us to a &amp;ldquo;solitary&amp;rdquo; journey. For instance, even within the same discipline, the researches we do still need certain extent of novelty so that many of us might never find some one doing exactly the same thing and have an in-depth chat about our passions. On the other hand, being doctoral researchers can also bring us a solidary benefit. We are that many (even within the Helmholtz society, there are currently about 8,500 DRs) and the greater challenges (beyond our specific research topic) are so similar for all of us (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03459-7%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03459-7)&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, staying connected with our peer DRs through networks as well as showing the representative status quo of our DR community is crucial to improve our living/working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is an example we have done as Helmholtz Juniors (HeJu) for showing our representative status quo of our DRs. We conduct a Helmholtz-wide PhD survey every two years and publish the results. We also communicate with the administrative units at each center by our local HeJu representatives and try to promote the living/working conditions for our DRs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;Today we host a post from Tatyana Dubich, head of the Communication Team.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helmholtz association (HA) consists of 18 different research centers, conducting excellent research in variety of topics from cancer research to energy technology. This research would not be possible without the most talented and motivated scientists performing it. Therefore talent management and recruiting more gifted scientists is crucial for the association’s wellbeing. And to attract the best minds, one has to provide the best working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost half of the scientists of Helmholtz Association are doctoral researchers and significant part of studies are performed and published by them. Independent of the field of study, most of the doctoral researchers work de facto full time, dedicating their work and passion to science, notwithstanding that working- and contract conditions, as well as even monthly salary differ from center to center, sometimes even in precarious ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(But) How come, that performing the same work we have different income? The main difference is coming from the fact, that not all of doctoral researcher have a working contract, but rather a stipend. Monthly income, social security, health insurance policy and amount of vacant days per year differ for doctoral researchers depending on center and contract situation. According to the Helmholtz Juniors’ survey 2014 and 2016, monthly net-income can differ up to 1.5 times between contract- and stipend-holders in different centers (900€ for stipends up to 2400€ for full 100% positions). Besides, not all researchers are paid till the completion (submission) of their PhD thesis. In some cases, they have to finish writing being de facto unemployed and unpaid, working towards their title without getting any income. It should be noticed that these stages of life, some doctoral researches already have family and children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the survey data, former Helmholtz Juniors speakers Dagmara and Elias together with working conditions group formulated a statement urging Helmholtz association administration to equalize the working conditions for doctoral researchers. Among their demands were general rejecting of stipends, fixing contracts to a minimum of 65% of TVöD E13, increased amount of holidays and providing a contract for all the PhD time till submission. The statement we put together and sent to head of HA Otmar Wiestler as well as to the directors/Human resources of the individual Helmholtz Centers in fall 2016 and in winter 2016 to the state secretary Thomas Rachel from the BMBF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statements were thoroughly discussed during Helmholtz Association annual meeting and on 7th of December 2016 HeJu received an official answer to the statements with the comments for every requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The burning question was if the stipends would be rejected in the Association. Unfortunately, Helmholtz association and BMBF do not see that the total abolishment of stipends is possible in the near future and refer to the guidelines of the Helmholtz association. Therefore, it is impossible to standardize the monthly income for all doctoral researchers. Generally, all the centres offering 65% TVöD E13 to contract-holders. However, the association can not influence the wage for stipend holders, especially if the stipend is not provided by Helmholtz itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increase in amount of vacant days per year cannot be expected soon as well for legal reasons. According to federal law, doctoral researchers with grant agreement can not have the same amount of holidays as TVöD-employees (30 days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, some of the topics were already addressed by the association while creating the ‘Guidelines for the completion of PhD projects within the Helmholtz Association’ issued in 2015. If you are a Doctoral researcher within Helmholtz Association and still have not seen the guidelines, contact your local HeJus or visit &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz.de/fileadmin/Guidelines-for-the-completion-of-PhD-projects-within-the-Helmholtz-Association.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;https://www.helmholtz.de/fileadmin/Guidelines-for-the-completion-of-PhD-projects-within-the-Helmholtz-Association.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guidelines address all aspects of PhD thesis completion, including the goals, the process itself, supervision, framework conditions and quality assurance. In particular, they recommend, that the promotion should be the main goal of PhD agreement and that ‘in consultation with the supervisory committee funding is to be sought until the submission of the dissertation to the university.’ Regulations of the supervision agreement and support to participate in graduate schools are also already a part of the Guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, are all the issues already fixed with the Guidelines issued? One should keep in mind that unfortunately they are not written in stone and it is more of a recommendation than a real law, obliging to treat doctoral researchers in a certain way. Besides, almost every research center has it’s own guidelines concerning PhD completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However the statements did initiate a change. Thus, Prof. Herzig, director of GEOMAR (Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research, Kiel), approved the statement and showed full support for Doctoral researchers. Working conditions for contract holders of the center had already fulfilled all the requirements of Helmholtz Juniors. Moved by the statement, administration of GEOMAR offered 75% FVöD contract to all internal stipend holders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s next? Are we done now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, HeJu will not stop with this achievement. Representatives from GEOMAR were able initiate the change in their centre. Now it is up to HeJu in other 17 centres to make the administration aware of the statements and convince them, that improvement of working conditions is necessary and use the example of GEOMAR to prove  that it’s possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidelines appeared in 2015, right after previous survey took place. With the survey 2017 we would like to evaluate whether or not they have brought a real change into doctoral researcher&amp;rsquo;s life and improved working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking forward to the survey result and based on it we are going to identify the remaining issues and address them. The results are going to be presented to Prof. O. Wiestler and critically discussed to further improve working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, we are in dialog with the Federal Ministry of Education and Research raising the awareness of the problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully with all the effort we will achieve perfect and comparable working conditions for doctoral researchers in all the centers, which will not only improve our wellbeing, but also allow us to attract best minds from all over the world, pushing research of our centres to a new level of excellence and help us bringing back our focus to the thing we are here for - science.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Meet Bernhard and Danja, of our survey group</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/07/meet-bernhard-and-danja-of-our-survey-group/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/07/meet-bernhard-and-danja-of-our-survey-group/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/07/meet-bernhard-and-danja-of-our-survey-group/images/LOGO_Blue2.png" alt="Featured image of post Meet Bernhard and Danja, of our survey group" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;To follow up our interview series, this month we would like to introduce you to the former and the current speakers of the Survey group, Danja and Bernhard. Danja worked on the establishment of the survey 2017, arranging the technical aspects since January 2016. Bernhard, the speaker of the 2017 survey group, had the task to run the survey and will lead the survey team through the analysis phase. Ultimately, the results of the survey will be made public and will be useful to get a coherent image of the status of the doctoral researchers among the Helmholtz Centers and to focus on the next steps we would like to take to improve our situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Survey is of great importance for Helmholtz Juniors. Survey 2014 was the ground on which we based our request to have better and comparable contracts among the centers. You will read about this in a soon-coming blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, we would like to leave the word to Danja Sarink, from &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum&lt;/a&gt; (DKFZ) and Bernhard Schuck from &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/startseite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;GeoForschungsZentrum&lt;/a&gt; (GFZ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="question-first-could-you-tell-us-a-bit-about-your-phd-project"&gt;Question: First, could you tell us a bit about your PhD project?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danja: I’m doing my PhD in cancer epidemiology, using a large European cohort study to analyze the relation between the Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor κβ-axis and breast cancer. My aims are mostly explorative: if and how these biomarkers relate to breast cancer in humans, but they could potentially be used to improve e.g. risk prediction or primary prevention of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernhard: Being a structural geologist, I focus on the Alpine Fault in New Zealand, which is the plate boundary between the Pacific and the Australian Plate. I aim to better understand what the rocks can tell us about the deformation mechanisms associated with large earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="q-we-are-all-part-of-the-helmholtz-association-what-do-you-think-is-the-value-of-being-part-of-it"&gt;Q: We are all part of the Helmholtz association. What do you think is the value of being part of it?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;D: I think the network it creates. It gave me the opportunity to meet other doctoral researchers from different fields, as well as to get a broader idea of research and academia in Germany outside my institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B: I agree with Danja. In addition, collaboration between individual centers representing a broad variety of research fields encourages us to think out of the box and to try new attempts to tackle scientific tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="q-how-have-you-first-learned-about-helmholtz-juniors-and-why-did-you-decide-to-join"&gt;Q: How have you first learned about Helmholtz Juniors and why did you decide to join?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;D: I learned about HeJu when I joined one of the working groups of the PhD council at the DKFZ. What drew me to HeJu was the more overarching nature of and the fact that it aims to address bigger picture things, that can be difficult to address on your own or even within your institute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="q-you-are-part-of-the-survey-group-that-is-vital-to-the-heju-to-gather-information-and-decide-future-strategies-how-would-you-define-the-work-done-by-your-group-and-what-could-be-achieved-with-it"&gt;Q: You are part of the survey group, that is vital to the HeJu to gather information and decide future strategies. How would you define the work done by your group and what could be achieved with it?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;D: We work in a two year cycle; one group sets up and runs the survey, the next analyses the data and publishes results. We worked closely with Helmholtz headquarters on e.g. legal aspects of the survey. Most of our work is in the background, but over the last few months our main task was communication; we did our best to annoy all HeJus into advertising the survey at their centers, and Immo Korte at Helmholtz Headquarters has been great in helping us reach all the Helmholtz centers. As for future strategies, I think ‘gather information and decide future strategies’ captures the aims of the survey group well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B: The survey and its results are the essential base for any discussion between the HeJus and any institution within the Helmholtz Association. However, this important role required that the workflows within the group had to be professionalized. This is one of the greatest achievements of past year’s survey group under Danja’s leadership. Data handling and security follow the essential guidelines and templates are prepared so that the next group can minimize the effort to be invested in formal requirements and focus on the aspects they want to get out of the survey. A major achievement of the survey is that it is widely accepted as reference to set minimum standards for the working conditions of doctoral researchers at the individual centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="q-being-a-member-of-the-survey-group-is-a-great-responsibility-and-probably-requires-a-good-amount-of-your-time-why-did-you-decide-to-join-this-group"&gt;Q: Being a member of the survey group is a great responsibility and probably requires a good amount of your time. Why did you decide to join this group?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;D: It actually seemed like less work than the working conditions or events group! I knew I wanted to join either the communications or survey group and decided for the survey group because I get to use some of my epi/public health skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B: In my case the decision was quite trivial. Benedikt, at that time the second HeJu from my center, was already part of the working conditions group. I don’t think communication is my strongest skill and the events group had already a fair number of members, I decided to join the smallest group: the survey group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="q-what-are-the-biggest-challenges-you-are-facing-or-faced-working-in-your-group"&gt;Q: What are the biggest challenges you are facing or faced working in your group?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;B: Besides the need to meet all the formal requirements, one of the biggest challenges is to keep the group member’s motivation high. Running and evaluating the survey is a quite time-consuming task and the potential for frustration is high. Bearing in mind that all group members are volunteering the speaker has to ensure that group sticks to the schedule and still has some fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D: I have to agree with Bernhard here that group-work can be fun and horribly frustrating at the same time, but I think we’ve also had a great core group of people in the survey group in both 2016 and 2017. For me, dealing with data protection and security issues was a learning curve. I knew it existed of course but I had never been directly involved with or responsible for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="q-what-do-you-think-is-the-next-challenge-of-the-survey-group-or-the-heju-in-general"&gt;Q: What do you think is the next challenge of the survey group or the HeJu in general?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;D: for the survey group, analyzing the data from this survey. We are also, for the first time, trying our hand at a time series analysis of some specific topics to see if there are any changes over time. For HeJu, a lot of work has been going on around working conditions and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz.de/en/about_us/press_and_media/events/nextgenhelmholtz_2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;NextGen@Helmholtz&lt;/a&gt;, which I think is absolutely awesome! While running the survey (and also in setting up NextGen@Helmholtz I think) we noticed that not nearly all docs know what HeJu is or does. We exist to represent all docs, so I think this is a challenge to tackle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B: Whereas analyzing the data of the survey 2017 and to carry out the time series analysis are goals to be achieved in the next months, having a proper hand-over to the next survey group will be the final challenge for this group. It would be a fantastic turnout on the time invested by last year’s group members, if we manage to provide the next survey group with all the information necessary to focus on preparing the questionnaire, setting-up and running the next survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="q-recently-a-lot-of-awareness-rose-on-the-correctness-of-data-communication-and-on-science-in-general-culminating-in-the-march-for-science-what-is-your-opinion-on-such-manifestations-and-movements"&gt;Q: Recently, a lot of awareness rose on the correctness of data communication and on Science in general, culminating in the March for Science. What is your opinion on such manifestations and movements?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;D: The awareness and very public discussion on science is great. On the short term it’s relevant to scientists, but I think that in the long term it’s relevant to everyone that good unbiased science exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B: My personal point of view is that these events are essential to communicate to society what science is about. A profound methodological base accepted by the scientific community is essential to achieve meaningful results. However, what these results tell us, how they should be interpreted and what consequences should arise, should and often is open to debate. There is no single expert to explain how the world works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="q-in-your-opinion-what-is-the-major-challenge-scientists-are-facing-in-their-relationship-with-society"&gt;Q: In your opinion, what is the major challenge scientists are facing in their relationship with society?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;B: Society invests tremendous amounts of money in science. Especially within the Helmholtz Association this money is often used to conduct fundamental research under fantastic working conditions. Scientists have to acknowledge that society has a right to get informed about their research in a way everyone is able to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D: I agree with Bernhard, he also makes a very good point in saying “…in a way everyone is able to understand”. Scientists are good at disseminating work to other scientists, but communication to the general public mostly happens through media. It would be great to see more focus on science communication in a broader form than manuscripts, conferences, and press releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="q-coming-to-a-conclusion-we-would-like-to-know-what-you-would-like-to-say-to-someone-interested-in-joining-the-helmholtz-juniors-should-they"&gt;Q: Coming to a conclusion, we would like to know what you would like to say to someone interested in joining the Helmholtz Juniors. Should they?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;D: Definitely! There is work involved of course but, if you’re interested, it’s also rewarding and the different working groups give you the chance to develop very different skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B: Absolutely. As doctoral researchers our training is closely related to the research we conduct, be it in the lab or when it comes to presenting the results in conferences and papers. Joining the HeJus encourages you to develop a number of soft skills like time and conflict management but also to see what and how things are done in different disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="q-as-a-last-question-would-you-like-to-share-your-favourite-moment-in-the-heju-and-explain-why-it-was-important-for-you"&gt;Q: As a last question, would you like to share your favourite moment in the HeJu and explain why it was important for you?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;D: I think HeJu has had a few fantastic achievements over the last year, with our letter about working conditions to the Helmholtz board and BMBF (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bmbf.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung&lt;/a&gt;) and our first NextGen@Helmholtz conference. I will have to go a bit smaller though; my highlight was running the survey. We invested a lot of time and had to jump some unexpected hurdles on the way, so it was very satisfying to see the live result!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B: The first NextGen@Helmholtz at HZI (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Helmholtz-Zentrum für Infektionsforschung&lt;/a&gt;) last year in Braunschweig with doctoral researchers from all over the country coming together and presenting what they do was a fantastic experience. But I agree with Danja, running the survey was my favorite moment, too. We spent so much time during the last year on all the preparation and had a rough time trying to finish the survey this February. Seeing that the survey was finally running and that the number of participants was constantly increasing was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Helmholtz Juniors Annual Meeting 2017: HeJus Achievements and Plan</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/06/helmholtz-juniors-annual-meeting-2017-hejus-achievements-and-plan/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/06/helmholtz-juniors-annual-meeting-2017-hejus-achievements-and-plan/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/06/helmholtz-juniors-annual-meeting-2017-hejus-achievements-and-plan/images/csm_group_photo_2017_web_cbdc94603d.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Helmholtz Juniors Annual Meeting 2017: HeJus Achievements and Plan" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Same time of year, different Helmholtz center!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year, in February, the Helmholtz Juniors annual meeting took place in the beautiful Heidelberg, where the old city and the state-of-the-art cancer research facilities of the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;German Cancer Research Center&lt;/a&gt; (DKFZ) meet! Thirty-four representatives from all Helmholtz centers joined the 3-days meeting. We were fortunate that the spokespersons of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.phdnet.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Max Planck PhDnet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.leibniz-gemeinschaft.de/en/careers/the-next-generation-of-researchers/leibniz-phd-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Leibniz PhD Network&lt;/a&gt; joined us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DKFZ was very hospitable. During the meeting, the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.dkfz.de/en/phd-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;graduate program&lt;/a&gt; director, Dr. Lindsay Murrells, introduced the research at DKFZ and its graduate school to us. On the DKFZ campus, there are 3,000 personnel working on cancer research, 540 of which are doctoral researchers. She also introduced us to the various services that the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.dkfz.de/en/career-service/Careers.html?m=1487783040" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a very special tour in two of the most modern facilities for cancer research and treatment in Europe, the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.dkfz.de/en/medphysrad/workinggroups/ultrahighfieldmr/ultrahighfieldmr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;High-Field Whole Body MR (7 Tesla)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.klinikum.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php?id=112189&amp;amp;L=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Facility (HIT)&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to the arrangements of DKFZ HeJus, Danja and Elias, we also enjoyed our time in the old town of Heidelberg. Photo credits go to Elias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we achieved in 2016:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the meeting, &lt;a class="link" href="http://blogs.helmholtz.de/hejus/2017/02/meet-dagmara-and-elias-our-spokespersons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Dagmara&lt;/a&gt;, HeJus Spokesperson in 2015/16, pointed out that one of the HeJus&amp;rsquo; goal is to improve doctoral researchers&amp;rsquo; working conditions, yet the occasion to hear them out are limited to the survey and the NextGen conference. She said, &amp;ldquo;If we cannot hear from them, we cannot help them.&amp;rdquo; What we achieved and plan to achieve clearly reflect this goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HeJus are organized into 4 working groups: &lt;strong&gt;working conditions, survey, communications, and events&lt;/strong&gt;. On the first day, the speakers of each group reported on what their groups have accomplished in 2016. No surprise there, the achievements were astonishing! The events group reported on &lt;a class="link" href="https://blogs.helmholtz.de/hejus/2016/11/nextgen-2016-conference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;NextGen 2016&lt;/a&gt;, the first German-wide meeting of Helmholtz doctoral researchers. We also met members of the dedicated team of talented PhD students at GEOMAR, Kiel organizing NextGen. The group also gave us a glimpse of then preliminary &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz.de/en/about_us/press_and_media/events/nextgenhelmholtz_2017/program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;program&lt;/a&gt; of NextGen@Helmholtz 2017 in Kiel&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The working conditions group has worked with all HeJus for years on the most optimal &lt;strong&gt;working conditions statement&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;ldquo;65% TVöD E13 payment, 30 days of vacation, and a contract of minimum 3 years from the beginning with the doctoral project as the main job objective.&amp;rdquo; The working conditions group sent their statement to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz.de/ueber_uns/die_gemeinschaft/praesident/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Prof. Dr. Otmar D. Wiestler&lt;/a&gt;, the President of the Helmholtz Association. Prof. Wiestler kindly offered his time to respond to the statement (we will publish his response in a following blog post). All HeJus has sent the statement to their respective directors, and Lisa, the HeJu from GEOMAR, has shared with us a remarkable success story. GEOMAR Dokteam has met with the Director, &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.geomar.de/en/mitarbeiter/d/pherzig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Prof. Peter Herzig&lt;/a&gt;, concerning the statement, and within 1 month &lt;strong&gt;GEOMAR changed the status of 13 in-house and Max Planck stipend holders into 75% TVöD contracts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the largest research association in Germany, and believing that science is not isolated from the political and societal scenes, the working conditions group also prepared a &lt;strong&gt;questionnaire and sent it to the main German political parties&lt;/strong&gt; about their views on scientific research. The HeJus are awaiting for the answers which will be publicly available to guide the German voters prior to the elections in September, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efforts of HeJus spokespersons in 2015/16 Dagmara and Elias have secured the HeJus &lt;strong&gt;a budget of 50,000 EUR per year for 3 years&lt;/strong&gt;. The spokespersons are the contact point and external representation of the HeJus. They communicate regularly with other PhD networks and with the Helmholtz Association. We now have a direct contact at the headquarters to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz.de/en/jobs_talent/funding_programs/doctoral_students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Dr. Johannes Freudenreich&lt;/a&gt;, who is known for his efforts promoting of young and early researchers with focus on postdocs, supervisors training and the newly formed international research schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey group shared with us the news that they have finished preparing &lt;strong&gt;the 2017 survey&lt;/strong&gt;. The available budged allowed them to run the survey on a secure platform. The survey covered many issues that are integral to the doctoral researchers such as: funding, supervision, graduate schools, working conditions, career plans, and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, all the updates, news, events and outreach have been brought to you by the communications group! We communicate the HeJus news to you through our various channels: the &lt;strong&gt;blog,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/helmholtz.juniors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/HelmholtzJrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/17993833/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; . We report on the various events that HeJus take part in. We also outreach for new HeJu members and introduce HeJus working groups to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we will achieve in 2017:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second day, we went on preparing our plan for 2017. The highlights are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/HelmholtzJrs/status/839768720243322880" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Network of Networks (N^2):&lt;/a&gt; The HeJus, Max Planck PhDnet and Leibniz PhD Network have been in close contact and exchange of experiences since the beginning of each of them. Now they formed N^2, a network for all doctoral researchers at all non-university research organizations in Germany. The first participation of N^2 was at the &lt;a class="link" href="https://blogs.helmholtz.de/hejus/2017/05/march-for-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;March For Science&lt;/a&gt;. N^2 plans joint events and call for interested doctoral researchers to participate in it. Stay tuned to know more about N^2 formation and activities here on the blog soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NextGen@Helmholtz at GEOMAR: NextGen is very special because it is an exclusive event of Helmholtz Association doctoral researchers. It has a unique nature as a multidisciplinary meeting. Its program includes a certificate-based science communication training. The alumni session is meant to provide the now students with various ideas of what is after-PhD. Through NextGen, we know about facilities at other Helmholtz Centers for perhaps future collaborations. Because of that all, the Hejus communicated to the graduate schools at all the centers to provide financial support and credit points for their doctoral researchers registering for NextGen.&lt;/p&gt;

data-flex-basis="360px"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Speakers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With their enthusiasm and expertise, we elected Giulia and Konstantin as the HeJus spokespersons for the year 2017. Giulia Caglio [&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.mdc-berlin.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine&lt;/a&gt; (MDC), Berlin] has been a member of the HeJus communications group. You certainly read her blog posts &lt;a class="link" href="http://blogs.helmholtz.de/hejus/about-the-authors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In the DokTeam, Giulia was proactive and had a sense of responsibility to improve the working conditions at her institute. She plans to pursue the same as a spokesperson of the HeJus. Konstantin Kuhne [&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf&lt;/a&gt; (HZDR), Dresden] was the HeJus treasurer for the past year. He gained an overview on the organization within the Helmholtz Association. We will hear from them here on the blog, and from the newly elected treasuress Lara Grünig from the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.hzg.de/index.php.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht Centre for Materials and Coastal Research&lt;/a&gt; (HZG).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what does that meeting mean for &amp;ldquo;non-HeJus&amp;rdquo;? We have a few recommendations in that regard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now officially in all HeJus documentations and communications we are all called &lt;strong&gt;“Doctoral Researchers”&lt;/strong&gt;! A term that precisely describes our day-to-day job at the largest research association in Germany, and empowers us to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctoral researchers are 50% of the working force at the Helmholtz Association and a significant fraction of the scientific output and publications is produced by doctoral researchers. The working conditions and survey groups &lt;strong&gt;need your input&lt;/strong&gt; from all the centers and to react upon it to improve the contracts and working conditions of the students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for a series of &lt;strong&gt;interviews and interesting research project from all the Helmholtz centers&lt;/strong&gt; here on the blog!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask the HeJu representatives of your center and your graduate school for our &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why to become a HeJu?&amp;rdquo; flyer&lt;/strong&gt;. Consider becoming the HeJu representative of your center in the next elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get involved!&lt;/strong&gt; If you missed NextGen 2017 registration, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/helmholtz.juniors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;like us&lt;/a&gt; and be ready for N^2 events and NextGen 2018!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&gt;Danja Sarink&lt;/a&gt;, PhD Candidate at the Division of Cancer Epidemiology, The German Cancer Research Center (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;DKFZ&lt;/a&gt;). Danja is also the spokesperson of the Survey Group of the HeJus. Now I leave you with a brilliant inside look at NextGen 2016!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 28-30 September Helmholtz Juniors hosted the very first NextGen@Helmholtz conference. Nearly &lt;strong&gt;120 doctoral researchers&lt;/strong&gt; from all Helmholtz centers joined us for action-packed: three days of networking, presenting and learning, at &lt;strong&gt;the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research&lt;/a&gt; in Braunschweig&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did we do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start the conference and to introduce all 18 Helmholtz Centers participants &lt;strong&gt;presented their institute in one minute&lt;/strong&gt;. We got a fantastic overview of the huge diversity of research going on in the Helmholtz Association – and the creativity of PhD students! Who knew that umbrellas make excellent jellyfish? And that maybe, next time, we should take into account when Oktoberfest happens!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main focus points of NextGen was &lt;strong&gt;multidisciplinary&lt;/strong&gt; and we challenged participants to explain their work to doctoral researchers from different fields; 83 participants presented their research in three poster sessions. There was naturally a lot of discussion between researchers from similar fields, but the amount of crosstalk – physicists explaining their work to sociologists, engineers asking about the work of geologists, and so on – was amazing to see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisa Bittner (Influence of pH on the toxicity of pharmaceuticals in zebrafish embryos, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=33573" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;UFZ&lt;/a&gt;), Mia Rudolph (Serial Protein Crystallography in Living Cells, &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.desy.de/index_eng.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;DESY&lt;/a&gt;) and Uli Einhaus (ROPPERI-A TPC readout with Timepix and pads, DESY) did an especially great job explaining their work, and received the &lt;strong&gt;poster awards&lt;/strong&gt;. Congratulations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six truly brave doctoral researchers participated in the &lt;strong&gt;NextGen Science Slam&lt;/strong&gt;, and we saw some really innovative takes on science – appealing to participants’ empathy, sense of humor and sense of rhythm. We have to give a honorable mention the impressive rap from UFZ’s very own McBiogas (Fabian Bonk), but the audience awarded the best science slam to Daniel Meza Arredondo from HZB, who talked about mom, Pesos and a chocolate vending machine on Mexikoplatz in Berlin, which was an excellent analogy for his work on solar cells. Congratulations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, at this point, everyone at NextGen knew all about the Helmholtz Association and how to present their doctoral work – &lt;strong&gt;but what comes after&lt;/strong&gt;? The classical path of doctorate-postdoc-professor is of course not nearly the only option for a doctoral researcher and the alumni session offered the opportunity for participants to talk to Helmholtz alumni about their career paths. The 12 alumni who joined were all at different stages in their careers – anywhere between postdoc and retired – and some had taken surprising career paths to get to their current jobs in various sectors, ranging from academia to science communication, to technology and product management in industry, to entrepreneurship and politics. The round tables were swamped and alumni spoke to participants to the absolute end of the session and, for those who could stay, even after the session ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alumni session was followed (after an amazing lunch) by a multidisciplinary workshop, where carefully randomized teams of doctoral researchers from all Helmholtz centers were put on the spot: &lt;strong&gt;how could humanity travel to and survive on Mars?&lt;/strong&gt; Every team was required to include all their members fields in their mission plan, but we kept other parameters for this task deliberately vague (will earth still be there to go back to? Will space travel exist?). Seven teams presented very varied takes and some very convincing reasoning on this challenge – a focus on the journey to Mars versus what to do on Mars, keeping the space craft operational versus using it for resources, living above ground versus living below, relying on trade versus Mars’ own resources. One of the most important tools for success is of course using the skills of everyone involved, and proposals were judged as such by Dr. Rebecca Ludwig, project manager with the cross-disciplinary &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.enlight-ten.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;ENLIGHT-TEN&lt;/a&gt; program. For missions this big, there can only be one winning proposal – Congratulations to the ingenious crew of M.Pathfinder!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, NextGen hosted an &lt;strong&gt;expert panel on the topic of “publish or perish”&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz.de/ueber_uns/die_gemeinschaft/praesident/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Prof. Wiestler&lt;/a&gt; (President of the Helmholtz Association), &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.jacobs-university.de/directory/alerchl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Prof. Alexander Lerchl&lt;/a&gt; (Jacobs University Bremen), &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/en/research/research_topics/anti_infectives/chemical_biology/mark_broenstrup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Prof. Mark Brönstrup&lt;/a&gt; (HZI Braunschweig), and &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.icm.tu-bs.de/%7Ebeick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Prof. Bettina Eick&lt;/a&gt; (TU Braunschweig). It was a great experience to listen to professionals talking about the broad topic, its influence on their fields of research, and how it relates to doctoral researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did we do well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two thirds of the participants completed our &lt;strong&gt;exit-survey&lt;/strong&gt;, and results were overwhelmingly positive! Nearly all participants rated NextGen@Helmholtz as very good (62%) or good (34%), and a stunning 88% would recommend it to others. The science slam (68% very good; 21% good) and alumni sessions (49% very good; 35% good) were rated as highlights of the program. Opinions on the poster session, multidisciplinary workshop, and expert panel were a bit more divided – though they were still rated as good or very good by at least half of the participants. The time available for and facilitation of networking (social activities, workshops, etc) during the conference were also well received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2016/11/nextgen-2016-more-than-a-conference/images/Picture1-2-1000x309.png"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are always things that could have gone better, and that we will of course aim to improve! The two points participants liked least were the venue for the poster session (5% very poor; 19% poor) and the time available for the multidisciplinary workshops (7% very poor; 24% poor[1]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A big “thank you!” to…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to extend a big “Thank you!” to the Helmholtz Association for making it possible for us to organize NextGen@Helmholtz, the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (HZI) in Braunschweig for hosting us, and to all speakers and participants for making it a success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next for NextGen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope NextGen@Helmholtz will continue to provide an informal and low pressure environment for doctoral researchers to talk and gain ideas about their science and their PhD (and beyond), and to try new approaches to presenting their work, both regarding new formats and people from completely unrelated fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye out for NextGen@Helmholtz 2017 at the Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.geomar.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to web page). Three days in Braunschweig for a multidisciplinary meeting that will involve 127 Doctoral Researchers and guests. Prof. Wiesler, President of the Helmholtz association, who believes on the importance of promoting the connection between Helmholtz institutes, will join for the expert panel talks, targeting the “Publish or Perish” philosophy in academia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3 days will give the researcher the possibility to network and learn about other institutes and peers research, present their work, as well as meet with Alumni to discuss future opportunities after the PhD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the slogan says, this is a conference organised by PhDs for PhDs and it has as main focus bringing together experts in different disciplines to foster ideas and discussions outside their field. The world is moving to a multidisciplinary approach everyday more, and the Helmholtz institutes offer a variety of expertise that could collaborate together. In this direction goes the challenge of the multidisciplinary workshop that will see different teams compete to plan the best way to colonize Mars - future is never too far! Additionally, science slam will offer an opportunity to practice communication skills, also in an unconventional way - dancing, acting, talking, everything is welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, as Helmholtz Juniors, are excited for this great opportunity and grateful for the immense work the event group put to make these 3 days unforgettable for all the participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you will like it and it will become the event the doctoral research will look forward in all the Helmholtz centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Spotlight on conditions for PhD students</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/04/spotlight-on-conditions-for-phd-students/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/04/spotlight-on-conditions-for-phd-students/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/04/spotlight-on-conditions-for-phd-students/images/HGJ_ENG_LOGO_S_RGB_white2.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Spotlight on conditions for PhD students" /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;This blog post is a statement of the Helmholtz Juniors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Followed by media response, the Max Planck Society recently announced dramatic changes in their support for doctoral students [1]. Without notable public attention, the Helmholtz Association also released their new guidelines for the completion of PhD projects [2]. These guidelines had been developed in the course of the last year with contributions of the Helmholtz Juniors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their guidelines, both large German research institutions stress the importance of doctoral students as first stage researchers who contribute significantly to the efforts of the research associations. The proclaimed aim is to support doctoral students at this career stage by offering appropriate structures, i.e. with regard to supervision, training, work infrastructures and career development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aspect drawing most attention on Max Planck was the announcement to bring the current scholarship practices to a termination and to offer every PhD student a support contract. The controversial issue of scholarships had been criticized in the past [3]. As Helmholtz Juniors we are delighted to see this shift in public opinion: That employment contracts (with social security benefits) for the whole time of the PhD project are seen as standard with scholarships being the exception, when appropriate. This is also how the Helmholtz Association formulates their vision on the PhD period in the newly released guidelines and how it is already implemented in most of the Helmholtz centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the new guidelines of the Helmholtz Association are only recommendations for the practice in the different Helmholtz centers, we are looking forward to collaborate with the centers to set this new framework into action on a local level. We hope that the new guidelines as well as the shift in public opinion can enhance a constructive dialogue on the situation of doctoral candidates in those centers of the Helmholtz Association where scholarship holders form the majority of PhD students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to know more about the issue of scholarships versus contracts, the new Helmholtz guidelines and the announced changes at the Max Planck Society? Then stay tuned to our blog, as more detailed information will be presented in the upcoming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time it is also possible to come to your own conclusions by looking at the data in the new &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.heju-survey.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;result viewer&lt;/a&gt; this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the previous years, the goal of this survey was to provide a profound basis for discussions between the PhD representatives, Helmholtz Juniors and the governance of each center and the Helmholtz Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore the topics cover the situation of the PhD candidates regarding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;funding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supervision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;satisfaction     &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special focus was on the situation of foreign PhD candidates and those with children. For everybody interested in improving their situation it is not only worth reading the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/fileadmin/user_upload/06_jobs_talente/Helmholtz-Juniors/Heju_Survey_2014_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;2014 report&lt;/a&gt; on the Helmholtz Juniors&amp;rsquo; Survey, but also the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/jobs_talente/doktorandenfoerderung/helmholtz_juniors/arbeitsgruppen_aktivitaeten" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;reports of previous years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, these survey results may serve as a basis for discussion with your Helmholtz Juniors representatives and your local PhD representatives, your Graduate School, your supervisor or colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next Helmholtz-wide survey will take place again next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To follow up the tradition of the survey, we are looking forward to your participation in 2016!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday afternoon, the last year’s speakers Nicholas Engel and Sripriya Murthy welcomed the previous and new Helmholtz Juniors to the meeting. The speakers of last year’s working groups presented their work and achievements and suggested topics for 2015. The survey group has finished the first evaluation of the 2014 survey. The evaluation is currently discussed and will be released roughly within the next two months. Further groups are “communication”, “event”, “working conditions” and “steadification”. See our homepage (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz.de/hejus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;www.helmholtz.de/hejus&lt;/a&gt;) for details on these groups. In the evening, the new Helmholtz Juniors chose their working groups. The groups of 2014 will be kept in 2015 and no new ones were established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second day started with a talk of Karin Lochte, head of the Alfred-Wegener-Institut, followed by a question and discussion session with her. After taking our group picture (the cover picture of the entry) we got a guided tour on the work of the AWI. Before lunch we met with Claudia Hanfland who coordinates the POLMAR graduate school (polmar.awi.de) and currently represents all Helmholtz graduate schools as their speaker. We discussed about the relevance of graduate schools and their function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, we had group working sessions in which the previous group’s speakers handed over their work to the new members. The first hours of group work were quite productive and we collected lots of new ideas and plans for 2015. Have a look on the picture of our group work sessions below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started on Friday with group working sessions and with electing group speakers. After that Xixi Feng presented PhDnet (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.phdnet.mpg.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;www.phdnet.mpg.de&lt;/a&gt;) which is the PhD candidate representation of the Max Planck Society. She is one of the speakers of PhDnet. There are some intersections in the topics on which HeJu and PhDnet work such as regular contracts instead of scholarships. Therefore we started sending speakers to each other’s annual meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last points on the agenda were the elections for the two HeJu speakers of 2015 and the decision on the location for the next year’s annual meeting. Daniel Neumann (Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht) and Meike Köhler (Helmholtz Zentrum München) were elected as speakers. The next year’s meeting will take place at the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) in Oberpfaffenhofen, close to Munich.&lt;/p&gt;

Let’s have a look back on the work of &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/en/working_at_helmholtz/doctoral_students/helmholtz_juniors/" title="Helmholtz-Juniors"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Helmholtz-Juniors&lt;/a&gt; (HeJu) in 2014 and take a look ahead to what’s to expect for 2015. Yuan (see authors) compiled our current &lt;a class="link" href="http://blogs.helmholtz.de/hejus/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2015/01/HeJu-Newsletter2014.pdf" title="HeJu-Newsletter 2014 (pdf)"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;HeJu-Newsletter2014&lt;/a&gt; which gives you an overview about the work of 2014 and our contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From January 22 to 24, 2014 the HeJus were kindly hosted by the Helmholtz Centre Dresden-Rossendorf (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=0" title="HZDR"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;HZDR&lt;/a&gt;) in Dresden for their annual meeting. During that meeting the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/en/jobs_talents/doctoral_students/helmholtz_juniors/working_groups_activities/" title="working groups"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;working groups&lt;/a&gt; presented their achievements of the previous term, and new goals where set for the next HeJu, namely us (most members are only active for one year, a list of currently active members you can find &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/en/jobs_talents/doctoral_students/helmholtz_juniors/current_helmholtz_juniors/" title="HeJu members"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The most important goals being set the realization of the Helmholtz PhD survey 2014 (survey group), the active participation in the formulation of an updated version of the official Helmholtz &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/fileadmin/user_upload/06_jobs_talente/Doktoranden/Leitlinien_Doktorandenausbildung.pdf" title="PhD guidelines"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;doctoral training guidelines&lt;/a&gt; (working conditions group), the finalization of “the PhD booklet” (communication group) and coming up with a new concept for an interdisciplinary event for PhDs of the Helmholtz Association (HA) (events group). We also spoke with a Helmholtz official about financial support for our plans and the function and position of the HeJu within the HA. Additionally, we welcomed a representative of &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.phdnet.mpg.de" title="PhDnet"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;PhDnet&lt;/a&gt;, the PhD network of the Max Planck Society (MPG). Although being an official part of the MPG, they are known to be very critical towards their mother organization and fight for just working conditions and appropriate remuneration. They shared valuable information about their experience within the MPG and how they are organizing themselves. Vice versa Sripriya, one of our spokespersons last year, attended the annual meeting of PhDnet in Heidelberg later in 2014 and brought back interesting ideas for funding new events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also discussed current problems. For instance only 14 of the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/en/helmholtz_centres_networks/helmholtz_centres/" title="Helmholtz centres"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;18 Helmholtz centres&lt;/a&gt; were represented at the HeJu annual meeting, despite the centres agreeing to cover travel expenses for the meeting. Some representatives complained that the general will of students to engage for a representative function (meaning the DokTeams or PhD initiatives) at the individual centres was rather low among PhD students. It was also pointed out that there were difficulties in reaching all the PhD students working at one centre due to size, structural organization and the lack of networking possibilities. Other problems included the identification of the basic needs of PhD students of different subjects and at different centres (for instance: significantly lower salaries for PhDs in life science than for PhDs in engineering or similar subjects, not to mention PhDs in social science or the ones living on stipends).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From July 21 to 22 the HeJu met again at a mid-term meeting at the HA’s headquarters in Berlin thanks to the efforts of the events team who managed to get us comfortable in Berlin, and in touch with the headquarters for 2 days. This time 16 out of 18 centres were represented. A more detailed report about this event you can find &lt;a class="link" href="http://blogs.helmholtz.de/hejus/2014/09/helmholtz-juniors-mid-term-meeting-2014/" title="HeJu Mid-Term Meeting 2014"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This gave us the possibility to check up on the progress of single projects and to rethink others. Just before the meeting the survey group put their questionnaire online and was able to show first figures (I hope you all took part!). The fully analysed results will soon follow (see below). Also a new working group was formed: the embodiment group. Inspired by the organization of PhDnet, its members were to evaluate if becoming an official body of the HA (including a fixed annual budget) was worth giving up our current independence. The working conditions group was actually able to leave their critical mark on the new doctoral training guidelines (to be released this year) and the communication group was invited to take a look behind the HA public relation department in order to increase HeJu&amp;rsquo;s visibility at the Helmholtz centres and beyond. As a result, we have this blog online since September 2014 and we hope you enjoy reading it. We will use it to keep you all updated about our work and also hope to get some discussions going about PhD life (or &lt;a class="link" href="http://blogs.helmholtz.de/hejus/2014/11/life-after-phd/" title="Life after PhD"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;after life&lt;/a&gt;) in general. Feel free to leave your comments and ideas and have a look on our &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/en/working_at_helmholtz/doctoral_students/helmholtz_juniors/" title="Helmholtz-Juniors"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and our new &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/helmholtz.juniors" title="HeJu Facebook"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;facebook page&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what’s to come in 2015? Big milestone ahead of course: the annual HeJu meeting at the Alfred Wegener Institute (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.awi.de" title="AWI"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;AWI&lt;/a&gt;) in Bremerhaven this week from January 14 to 16! There we will see how happy YOU are and at which centre you are happiest according to the results of the Helmholtz PhD survey. Information, each individual centre is also very interested in. We will present an online version of the PhD booklet (due to difficulties with the layout, a print version will only be available at a later time point but, we wanted to make sure that you can access this information asap). We hope that many of new and old PhD students in Germany will find it very useful. We will discuss our impact on the new Helmholtz doctoral training guidelines and the pros and cons of an official embodiment within the HA. We will see what concept the event group came up with and if we will again get support for an additional mid-term meeting. One of the more difficult topics is the question if PhD students should get stipends or contracts. There is a will of the HA to provide each PhD student with a contract rather than a stipend but, this is, of course, not yet reality. Given the tight financial situation for personnel money in science in general and at certain centres in particular, this will still be an issue in the future. An issue that probably has to be discussed with Otmar Wiestler, now head of the German Cancer Research Centre (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.dkfz.de" title="DKFZ"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;DKFZ&lt;/a&gt;), who will replace Jürgen Mlynek after 10 years as HA&amp;rsquo;s new president in September this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very important point will be the handing over of our work to the ones of you that will take over our tasks. Due to the short HeJu terms, a thorough transfer of information is crucial for an efficient continuation. Thus, let’s look forward to what the next HeJu generation will have in store for us. I will surely keep checking up on the news here. Good luck! :)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Helmholtz Juniors' Mid-Term Meeting 2014</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2014/09/helmholtz-juniors-mid-term-meeting-2014/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2014/09/helmholtz-juniors-mid-term-meeting-2014/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2014/09/helmholtz-juniors-mid-term-meeting-2014/images/MeetingProfM.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Helmholtz Juniors' Mid-Term Meeting 2014" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end of July the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/en/working_at_helmholtz/doctoral_students/helmholtz_juniors/" title="HeJus"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Helmholtz-Juniors&lt;/a&gt; (or more informally “HeJu”) got together for their mid-term meeting at the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/en/about_us/" title="Helmholtz Association"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Helmholtz Association&lt;/a&gt;’s head office in Berlin. It was the second time we met this year after our first meeting at the Helmholtz Center Dresden-Rossendorf (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=139" title="HZDR"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;HZDR&lt;/a&gt;) in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is useful to mention here that the HeJu’s are not an official body of the Helmholtz Association, but a diverse group of volunteering PhD students who are committed to improve PhD working conditions and connect PhDs within the Helmholtz Association as well as within Germany (look at this &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/en/helmholtz_centres_networks/helmholtz_centres/" title="Helmholtz Centers"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; to see where we are located). This includes a cacophony of emails, phone calls, doodle lists, literature research and skype conferences. And all that we are trying to manage on the side to our own demanding PhD projects, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I was really looking forward to the meeting as we had set ambitious goals back in January and our predecessors had informed us that it might be difficult to keep up the motivation for our projects throughout the entire year. Thus, we decided to get together again already after half a year to renew our HeJu energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there we were: One and a half days full of reports, heated discussions, brainstorming and coffee overflow. First of all our spokespersons Nicholas and Sripriya and our four &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/en/jobs_talents/doctoral_students/helmholtz_juniors/working_groups_activities/" title="Working Groups"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;working groups&lt;/a&gt; presented the progress so far. The main achievements have been the active participation in an update of the Helmholtz Association’s official PhD guidelines (which virtually has some effect on all Helmholtz PhD students), the finishing of our “Helmholtz PhD booklet” (we will keep you posted about this!) and the launch of this year’s &lt;a class="link" href="http://heju-survey.de" title="HeJu Survey"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;PhD survey&lt;/a&gt; (where every PhD student under Helmholtz can actually help to improve the conditions, hopefully you all took part. But, don’t worry if not, it’s still possible until Sep 19th!!! Go for it!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2014/09/helmholtz-juniors-mid-term-meeting-2014/images/events-300x199.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to our “events” group who was busy organizing this meeting we’ve been in close contact with officials of the Helmholtz Association and the direct feedback was helping a lot to shape common goals and to identify certain (im)possibilities. For instance, what financial support can we expect and what are the advantages and disadvantages of becoming an official body of the Helmholtz Association? A topic so fundamental, that the formation of a new working group was required to evaluate its pros and cons. But, a special treat for us was the visit of Prof. Dr. Jürgen Mlynek, &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/en/about_us/president/" title="HA president"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;president&lt;/a&gt; of the Helmholtz Association, who took some time to welcome us personally in the headquarter and also stayed for a quick Q&amp;amp;A session (see header). How much closer can you get as a PhD student to the very head of your research organization?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2014/09/helmholtz-juniors-mid-term-meeting-2014/images/EmbodimentGroup-300x199.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During several sessions the individual working groups discussed and developed new ideas and eventually set the goals for the rest of the term. Furthermore, we were lucky to talk with the public relations officials, who gave us vital support on our visibility and communication structure as well as an insight into their day-to-day work. A result of which we have this brand new Blog you happened to be reading right now and the new &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/helmholtz.juniors?fref=ts" title="HeJu FB"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;HeJu’s logo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is left to do for this year? Of course, the discussion on the PhD guidelines is not over yet and will go on. One goal, for example, is to increase contract positions for PhDs in relation to scholarships. The “survey” group will have a busy time analyzing the survey results and wrapping that up until January next year, when the HeJu’s meet again at the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.awi.de/en/home/" title="AWI"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Alfred Wegener Institute&lt;/a&gt; in Bremerhaven. The PhD booklet will be published and available for everyone who’s interested (some interviews with the people involved will be up as well). We are also planning a special event where PhD students can connect and get information on career options and this Blog will be filled with more articles about our work as HeJu’s and topics about PhD life in general. Feel free to comment and ask questions below.&lt;/p&gt;
