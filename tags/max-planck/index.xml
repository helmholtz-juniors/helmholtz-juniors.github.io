&lt;p&gt;Last week, we reported about the changes in the way PhD students are to be treated in the Helmholtz Association. As could be read in the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.zeit.de/2015/13/max-planck-institut-doktorand-forschung" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;German news&lt;/a&gt; in March and April 2015, the Max Planck Society has meanwhile not been inactive: On March 23rd, the Max Planck Society published a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.mpg.de/9067759/enhanced-funding-junior-scientists-max-planck-society" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; presenting a plan to spend “50 million Euro for junior scientists”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, one can split the attempts to improve the situation of PhD students and postdocs into two parts: give every doctoral student and every PostDoc a contract and improve the supervision by providing at least a second Professor as supervisor and mentor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;== The two-class society of stipend holders and contract holders==&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more than 3400 stipend funded PhD students, the Max Planck Society is one of the biggest providers of PhD positions in Germany. Many PhD students come from abroad, and until now most of them have been provided with a stipend instead of a regular contract. But what is the problem with stipends? Although stipends offer benefits like more independence, they have some major disadvantages like lack of social securities, health and unemployment insurance, parental leave and pension, to name just a few. A more detailed description of the pros and cons of stipends can be found here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To eliminate this funding-based difference between PhD students, the Max Planck Society will spend 50 million Euro per year to provide contracts instead of stipends to all of their doctoral students and postdocs. Furthermore, these contracts are granted for three years with an opportunity to extend for another year, so that students can focus on their work instead of worrying about follow-up funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the drawbacks of conventional staff contracts, however, is that PhD students also have to work on projects not related to their PhD topic (as it is e. g. still usual in engineering), such as giving lectures, supervising practical courses or performing routine tasks for their institute. Similar to the independence of these tasks granted by a stipend and unlike conventional contracts, these new PhD contracts are designed to ensure that you are not working on unrelated topics, but only on your own project. However, some drawbacks remain: there are exceptions to the no-stipend rule for guests working “on a particular project and for a limited time” who can still be funded by stipends without social security. These new guidelines do not affect any existing contracts or stipends and it is still unclear what the actual contracts encompass with regards to salary and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;== Supervision ==&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second big issue addressed is the situation of supervision of doctoral students and their perspectives after finishing the PhD. The Max Planck Society is aware of the situation that less than 10 % of PhDs stay in science. Therefore more than 90 % of the PhD students would benefit from courses and programs preparing them for jobs in industry or economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another more challenging approach for improving this situation is setting up contracts between the candidate, the supervising professor and another third person at a university. In the case of conflict between candidate and supervisor the third person mediates between the supervisor and the PhD student. The President of the Max Planck Society, Martin Statmann, hopes that each Professor supervising a student recognises and clearly communicates if a doctoral student is well suited for a career in research or if other branches seem to be more promising for the student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, this new development at the Max Planck Society is a big step in the right direction with still some minor flaws.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Spotlight on conditions for PhD students</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/04/spotlight-on-conditions-for-phd-students/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/04/spotlight-on-conditions-for-phd-students/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/04/spotlight-on-conditions-for-phd-students/images/HGJ_ENG_LOGO_S_RGB_white2.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Spotlight on conditions for PhD students" /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;This blog post is a statement of the Helmholtz Juniors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Followed by media response, the Max Planck Society recently announced dramatic changes in their support for doctoral students [1]. Without notable public attention, the Helmholtz Association also released their new guidelines for the completion of PhD projects [2]. These guidelines had been developed in the course of the last year with contributions of the Helmholtz Juniors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their guidelines, both large German research institutions stress the importance of doctoral students as first stage researchers who contribute significantly to the efforts of the research associations. The proclaimed aim is to support doctoral students at this career stage by offering appropriate structures, i.e. with regard to supervision, training, work infrastructures and career development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aspect drawing most attention on Max Planck was the announcement to bring the current scholarship practices to a termination and to offer every PhD student a support contract. The controversial issue of scholarships had been criticized in the past [3]. As Helmholtz Juniors we are delighted to see this shift in public opinion: That employment contracts (with social security benefits) for the whole time of the PhD project are seen as standard with scholarships being the exception, when appropriate. This is also how the Helmholtz Association formulates their vision on the PhD period in the newly released guidelines and how it is already implemented in most of the Helmholtz centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the new guidelines of the Helmholtz Association are only recommendations for the practice in the different Helmholtz centers, we are looking forward to collaborate with the centers to set this new framework into action on a local level. We hope that the new guidelines as well as the shift in public opinion can enhance a constructive dialogue on the situation of doctoral candidates in those centers of the Helmholtz Association where scholarship holders form the majority of PhD students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to know more about the issue of scholarships versus contracts, the new Helmholtz guidelines and the announced changes at the Max Planck Society? Then stay tuned to our blog, as more detailed information will be presented in the upcoming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
