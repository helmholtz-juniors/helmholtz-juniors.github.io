In 2014 all 6000 PhD candidates of the 18 Helmholtz centers had been asked in the 4th bi-annual survey about their main issues and the conditions they are working under. 1483 PhD students participated, and their answers can now be found in an [extensive report](http://www.helmholtz.de/fileadmin/user_upload/06_jobs_talente/Helmholtz-Juniors/Heju_Survey_2014_report.pdf) which summarises the findings of this survey.

For the first time it is also possible to come to your own conclusions by looking at the data in the new [result viewer](https://www.heju-survey.de) this year.

As in the previous years, the goal of this survey was to provide a profound basis for discussions between the PhD representatives, Helmholtz Juniors and the governance of each center and the Helmholtz Association. 

Therefore the topics cover the situation of the PhD candidates regarding

- funding
- supervision
- satisfaction     
- working conditions
- infrastructure

Special focus was on the situation of foreign PhD candidates and those with children. For everybody interested in improving their situation it is not only worth reading the [2014 report](http://www.helmholtz.de/fileadmin/user_upload/06_jobs_talente/Helmholtz-Juniors/Heju_Survey_2014_report.pdf) on the Helmholtz Juniors' Survey, but also the [reports of previous years](http://www.helmholtz.de/jobs_talente/doktorandenfoerderung/helmholtz_juniors/arbeitsgruppen_aktivitaeten).

Furthermore, these survey results may serve as a basis for discussion with your Helmholtz Juniors representatives and your local PhD representatives, your Graduate School, your supervisor or colleagues.

The next Helmholtz-wide survey will take place again next year.

To follow up the tradition of the survey, we are looking forward to your participation in 2016!
