Our HeJu survey team explains you what is it like to be a doctoral researcher at a Helmholtz Center" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weather you are currently thinking of doing a PhD or you are already a doctoral  researcher (DR), it might always quite interesting to know how is it like to be a doctoral researcher at the largest scientific organization in Germany. More specifically, how are DRs networked? How diverse are DRs? or to be of most interest of many of you, how well is a DR being paid?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our newest survey (report is here: &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz.de/fileadmin/user_upload/06_jobs_talente/Helmholtz-Juniors/Survey_Report2019_update.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;https://www.helmholtz.de/fileadmin/user_upload/06_jobs_talente/Helmholtz-Juniors/Survey_Report2019_update.pdf&lt;/a&gt;  ), we have (as always) put these points into perspective and asked our DRs what is it like to be a doctoral researcher at a Helmholtz Center. Below, our survey team will tell you some of the key results from the survey:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, we reported about the changes in the way PhD students are to be treated in the Helmholtz Association. As could be read in the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.zeit.de/2015/13/max-planck-institut-doktorand-forschung" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;German news&lt;/a&gt; in March and April 2015, the Max Planck Society has meanwhile not been inactive: On March 23rd, the Max Planck Society published a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.mpg.de/9067759/enhanced-funding-junior-scientists-max-planck-society" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; presenting a plan to spend “50 million Euro for junior scientists”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, one can split the attempts to improve the situation of PhD students and postdocs into two parts: give every doctoral student and every PostDoc a contract and improve the supervision by providing at least a second Professor as supervisor and mentor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;== The two-class society of stipend holders and contract holders==&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more than 3400 stipend funded PhD students, the Max Planck Society is one of the biggest providers of PhD positions in Germany. Many PhD students come from abroad, and until now most of them have been provided with a stipend instead of a regular contract. But what is the problem with stipends? Although stipends offer benefits like more independence, they have some major disadvantages like lack of social securities, health and unemployment insurance, parental leave and pension, to name just a few. A more detailed description of the pros and cons of stipends can be found here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To eliminate this funding-based difference between PhD students, the Max Planck Society will spend 50 million Euro per year to provide contracts instead of stipends to all of their doctoral students and postdocs. Furthermore, these contracts are granted for three years with an opportunity to extend for another year, so that students can focus on their work instead of worrying about follow-up funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the drawbacks of conventional staff contracts, however, is that PhD students also have to work on projects not related to their PhD topic (as it is e. g. still usual in engineering), such as giving lectures, supervising practical courses or performing routine tasks for their institute. Similar to the independence of these tasks granted by a stipend and unlike conventional contracts, these new PhD contracts are designed to ensure that you are not working on unrelated topics, but only on your own project. However, some drawbacks remain: there are exceptions to the no-stipend rule for guests working “on a particular project and for a limited time” who can still be funded by stipends without social security. These new guidelines do not affect any existing contracts or stipends and it is still unclear what the actual contracts encompass with regards to salary and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;== Supervision ==&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second big issue addressed is the situation of supervision of doctoral students and their perspectives after finishing the PhD. The Max Planck Society is aware of the situation that less than 10 % of PhDs stay in science. Therefore more than 90 % of the PhD students would benefit from courses and programs preparing them for jobs in industry or economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another more challenging approach for improving this situation is setting up contracts between the candidate, the supervising professor and another third person at a university. In the case of conflict between candidate and supervisor the third person mediates between the supervisor and the PhD student. The President of the Max Planck Society, Martin Statmann, hopes that each Professor supervising a student recognises and clearly communicates if a doctoral student is well suited for a career in research or if other branches seem to be more promising for the student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, this new development at the Max Planck Society is a big step in the right direction with still some minor flaws.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Helmholtz Juniors Annual Meeting 2015 in Bremerhaven</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/01/helmholtz-juniors-annual-meeting-2015-in-bremerhaven/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/01/helmholtz-juniors-annual-meeting-2015-in-bremerhaven/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/01/helmholtz-juniors-annual-meeting-2015-in-bremerhaven/images/Helmholtz-Juniors_FB-scaled.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Helmholtz Juniors Annual Meeting 2015 in Bremerhaven" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s annual meeting of the Helmholtz Juniors took place at the Alfred-Wegener-Institut (AWI) from the 14th to the 16th of January. New Helmholtz Juniors were introduced. We re-formed our working groups, elected new speakers and had interesting discussions and a nice time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday afternoon, the last year’s speakers Nicholas Engel and Sripriya Murthy welcomed the previous and new Helmholtz Juniors to the meeting. The speakers of last year’s working groups presented their work and achievements and suggested topics for 2015. The survey group has finished the first evaluation of the 2014 survey. The evaluation is currently discussed and will be released roughly within the next two months. Further groups are “communication”, “event”, “working conditions” and “steadification”. See our homepage (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz.de/hejus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;www.helmholtz.de/hejus&lt;/a&gt;) for details on these groups. In the evening, the new Helmholtz Juniors chose their working groups. The groups of 2014 will be kept in 2015 and no new ones were established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second day started with a talk of Karin Lochte, head of the Alfred-Wegener-Institut, followed by a question and discussion session with her. After taking our group picture (the cover picture of the entry) we got a guided tour on the work of the AWI. Before lunch we met with Claudia Hanfland who coordinates the POLMAR graduate school (polmar.awi.de) and currently represents all Helmholtz graduate schools as their speaker. We discussed about the relevance of graduate schools and their function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, we had group working sessions in which the previous group’s speakers handed over their work to the new members. The first hours of group work were quite productive and we collected lots of new ideas and plans for 2015. Have a look on the picture of our group work sessions below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started on Friday with group working sessions and with electing group speakers. After that Xixi Feng presented PhDnet (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.phdnet.mpg.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;www.phdnet.mpg.de&lt;/a&gt;) which is the PhD candidate representation of the Max Planck Society. She is one of the speakers of PhDnet. There are some intersections in the topics on which HeJu and PhDnet work such as regular contracts instead of scholarships. Therefore we started sending speakers to each other’s annual meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last points on the agenda were the elections for the two HeJu speakers of 2015 and the decision on the location for the next year’s annual meeting. Daniel Neumann (Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht) and Meike Köhler (Helmholtz Zentrum München) were elected as speakers. The next year’s meeting will take place at the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) in Oberpfaffenhofen, close to Munich.&lt;/p&gt;
