&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recruiting top national and international talent is a major challenge in the highly competitive field of academic research and is of crucial importance to the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres (HGF). To succeed in the race for scientific progress, the HGF must offer attractive and reliable working conditions for its early-career researchers. In practice, however, individual contracts are predominantly concluded between the respective Helmholtz Centers and doctoral researchers, which reduces both the transparency of contract terms and the equal opportunity goals pursued by the HGF. As the voice of doctoral researchers within the HGF, the Helmholtz Juniors advocate for integrating all doctoral researchers employed at Helmholtz Centers into the collective agreement for the public sector (TVöD), pay grade E13. This is the only way to ensure fair and transparent working conditions and attract top-tier talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following outlines the advantages of collective agreements over individual contracts, often referred to as funding agreements. In contrast, scholarships typically fail to provide the necessary social security and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="collective-agreements-create-transparency"&gt;Collective Agreements Create Transparency
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science, as an international field of work, requires regulations that are transparent and understandable in an international context1. In a statement on the amendment of the Act on Temporary Scientific Contracts (WissZeitVG), the Alliance of Science Organisations in Germany warned against the risk of a confusing diversity of regulations and, in the worst case, disparities between institutions2. The Max Planck Society, for example, offers at least standardized (funding) contracts, whereas the HGF features a remarkable diversity of contracts for doctoral researchers. The most common type of contract in the HGF is individual, non-tariff agreements with durations of two to four years and compensation ranging from 55% to 100% of a full-time position. Only about a third of the centers apply the TVöD on an individual basis. Despite having an application agreement with the United Services Union (ver.di), two Helmholtz Centers effectively exclude doctoral researchers from the collective agreement by invoking § 1 para. 2 letter s of the TVöD. Two other centers are affiliated with universities due to their historical development and therefore apply the collective agreement for the public service of the federal states (TV-L), which uses a different pay scale. This inconsistent and arbitrary patchwork of rules not only prevents transparency but also creates inequalities among doctoral researchers within the HGF. This undermines equal opportunity and makes working conditions difficult to understand from an international perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="collective-agreements-ensure-equal-opportunity"&gt;Collective Agreements Ensure Equal Opportunity
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improving equal opportunity is a central priority in the HGF - this principle is firmly anchored in the HGF&amp;rsquo;s mission and is an integral part of its talent management3. Through their uniformity, collective agreements are an important tool that can significantly promote equal opportunity across the HGF. Collective agreements establish a standardized minimum framework that is regularly negotiated publicly and applies to all doctoral researchers. They ensure standardized regulations for working hours and vacation, recognize professional experience in compensation, and provide social security through additional benefits such as occupational pension schemes. In contrast, individual contracts can vary significantly in content and are subject to the unilateral stipulations of funding bodies, such as the Federal Ministry for Research, Technology and Space (BMFTR), formerly the Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF), which define only maximum standards - allowing individual institutes to make downward deviations at their discretion. This opens the door to potential misuse and disadvantages for individual doctoral researchers. With collective bargaining, any changes to the agreement are automatically applied to all employment contracts. In contrast, individual contracts only reflect new rules in newly signed agreements. Thus, collective agreements ensure full transparency and lay the foundation for equal opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="collective-agreements-increase-attractiveness-and-satisfaction"&gt;Collective Agreements Increase Attractiveness and Satisfaction
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sustainable and fair working conditions are not only key to long-term viability but also decisive for the lasting attractiveness and success of research institutions in an increasingly competitive academic landscape - a principle the Helmholtz Association already established in its 2016 sustainability management guidelines (LeNa). These guidelines emphasized the importance of developing new career paths and avoiding precarious employment, particularly for early-career researchers&lt;a class="link" href="#_ftn2" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;4&lt;a class="link" href="#_ftn2" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Competitive working conditions are the basis for attracting and retaining talented young scientists from both national and international backgrounds5,6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2020 study found that good working conditions and career prospects are key drivers of innovation in academic research7. Establishing good working conditions has twofold benefits: on the one hand, secure employment leads to higher satisfaction and productivity&lt;a class="link" href="#_ftn4" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;8&lt;a class="link" href="#_ftn4" &gt;&lt;/a&gt;; on the other hand, it enhances the employer’s appeal to international top talent. Job satisfaction is therefore a critical factor in the attractiveness of the public science sector. By introducing transparent, uniform contracts based on binding institutional application of the TVöD for doctoral researchers, the HGF can offer its early-career researchers sustainable, fair, and favorable working conditions - ensuring the retention of young talent amid a shortage of skilled workers in the public research sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="collective-agreements-reduce-bureaucracy"&gt;Collective Agreements Reduce Bureaucracy
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2023 inflation compensation payment demonstrated that the diversity of contract types results in increased administrative workload and uncertainty among doctoral researchers. Introducing the collective agreement for all doctoral researchers would simplify administrative processes and create independence from the directives of funding bodies such as the BMFTR, since collective bargaining law overrides ministerial guidelines and authorizations. This benefits both researchers and administrative staff, fosters a coherent and efficient organizational structure, enhances transparency, and strengthens the Helmholtz Centers&amp;rsquo; appeal as employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we emphasize that the binding institutional application of the TVöD without exception for all doctoral researchers at all Helmholtz Centers is a necessary measure. It aligns with the interests of the HGF by increasing its competitiveness in recruiting national and international talent, ensuring high satisfaction and productivity among researchers, promoting equal opportunity, and simplifying administrative processes. By supporting this initiative, the HGF can further strengthen its position as a leading actor in research and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Helmholtz Juniors represent around 8,000 doctoral researchers within the Helmholtz Association. They advocate for the introduction of collective agreements for doctoral researchers across the entire Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres. This position was unanimously adopted at the Helmholtz Juniors Annual Meeting in 2024.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open communication is key for a good working environment, effective collaboration, and a healthy relationship with your co-workers and supervisors. The ability to communicate well is crucial for working efficiently and successfully- especially during a doctorate. It is well known that a doctorate comes with a multitude of challenges unrelated to the actual research itself. Young researchers often face problems that are not only related to completely neutral working topics but are also on a personal level, which brings emotions into the mix. This includes problems with co-workers and quite often with the supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being emotionally involved makes it more challenging to communicate issues effectively and in a constructive manner. The real problem then is often not the actual problem, but rather the stimulated emotions. To make matters worse, communicating feelings at work is still sometimes perceived as unprofessional, weak, and inappropriate when precisely the opposite is true. Good communication is essential for maintaining not only a healthy working environment, but also good mental health and a free mind. In addition, learning how to communicate effectively leads to both personal and interpersonal growth. So, &lt;strong&gt;what IS the best way to communicate your problems and how it makes you feel?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is no one single solution for all problems, here are some general pointers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before reacting impulsively with strong emotions, take a deep breath and try to distance yourself from the situation. Practice some self-awareness. What is it that you are feeling? Understand your own emotions, so you can express yourself more clearly. Depending on the situation, it might be helpful to talk to a trusted friend or colleague about the circumstances. Maybe write down what the problem is and how it makes you feel. Where did this problem originate, and do you have a solution you could propose? Do you think you can solve the problem by yourself? If not, don’t hesitate to tackle the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When addressing problems, remember: the time and place matter. Choose a moment when both parties are receptive. Talk somewhere where you will not be interrupted or disturbed. Both parties should take the time needed to discuss with no time limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When communicating your problems, try to be as clear and specific as possible. Explain your problems and interests and if possible, give concrete examples. This helps the other party understand the issue and makes the issue tangible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People tend to quickly feel attacked, therefore when talking about the problem, use “I-statements”. Employ phrases such as “This gives me the feeling&amp;hellip;” or “This gives me the impression&amp;hellip;” and avoid direct confrontations like “You are&amp;hellip;” or “You always do XYZ&amp;hellip;”. Criticism in any situation should remain constructive. By staying with your emotions, it shifts the focus to your feelings and promotes empathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to express how a problem is affecting &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, how it makes &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; feel. This more constructive than blaming or attacking the other person directly, which should be avoided. Direct criticism of a person can hurt the other party, incite retaliation, and create even more problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different points of view for every problem. The main goal is for all parties to understand each others’ points of view. This can help deescalate the situation and hopefully lead to a resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to the other party and allow them to answer without interruption. Keep in mind that their feelings are also valid. Try to understand their point of view and listen to their interests. If the situation becomes emotional, make sure to stay calm and respectful to foster a more positive outcome. Be open to apologizing when needed or appropriate. Maybe the other party did react out of emotions as well and both of you can approach each other. Try to stay in the present with a focus on the future. Do not be too hung up on the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are often dependencies in a working environment which you cannot easily dissolve or also do not intend to. That is why it is important to seek for a solution together which is suitable for all parties. Try to find areas of agreement upon which you can build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use expressions such as: “I feel like we are stuck, and I understand that the underlying reasons could be this and this. I would need a more supportive collaboration, and therefore I would appreciate X and Y. Of course, I want to support you on the same level. What would you need? How can we improve the situation?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After communicating your problem, take some time and reflect on the situation and on what was discussed. Keep up the communication to ensure progress in resolving the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel that the communication barrier is too high, involving a mediator can be a good idea. This can be a supervisor, but also an ombudsperson. Companies and institutes do often have persons specially trained in helping handle and resolve such situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, in some working environments, communicating your problems as a female comes with even more challenges such as being perceived as weak, and when speaking up, pushy. Here, it is important to not let yourself be silenced. If you face unjust criticism, stay consistent, stay strong. Such reactions say more about them and their inability to interface with strong women and less about you. In such situations it might be helpful to speak up and clearly reject such statements. Do not tolerate sexism at any point. Females communicating problems in a constructive, calm manner should not be subject to being called “tough” and “pushy” and being told to get out of their “victim-hood”. This is a failure in communication by the other party, and we suggest asking for a mediator or talking to a supervisor. Do not, however, let it stop you from communicating your problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, communication styles differ from culture to culture. While Germans tend to have a very direct way of communication, this is different in other cultures. The German way of communication can be perceived as impolite or offensive. However, in some cultures, silence is a strong form of communication, which can be missed if one is unaware of such culture-specific cues. These cultural differences should always be kept in mind and considered, especially in our very international work environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Standing against Hate and Division – For a Strong Scientific Hub</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2025/02/standing-against-hate-and-division-for-a-strong-scientific-hub/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2025/02/standing-against-hate-and-division-for-a-strong-scientific-hub/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2025/02/standing-against-hate-and-division-for-a-strong-scientific-hub/images/We-stand-for-democratic-values.png" alt="Featured image of post Standing against Hate and Division – For a Strong Scientific Hub" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defending democratic values and preserving academic freedom sustainably strengthens Germany as a scientific hub with a future-oriented perspective. The upcoming federal election in particular, is a decisive moment for the future—and, therefore, for science as well. As an important scientific hub, Germany has the opportunity to establish itself as the innovation hub of the future. For this, democratic values, openness, diversity, and internationality are the key prerequisites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent months have shown that right-wing populist parties repeatedly question the necessity of future-oriented research in fields such as social sciences, climate research, healthcare, and projects on diversity and migration. Attacks like these not only threaten academic freedom but also political advisory, which is essential for a future-oriented society, innovation, and economy. In contrast, open and democratic systems promote exchange between research institutions, industry, and politics, thereby laying the foundation for sustainable innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany can only be an attractive international cooperation partner as a democratic, open, and tolerant country—because research thrives on dialogue. An open and diverse scientific culture fosters free thinking and a plurality of opinions—these are fundamental principles of democracy and essential for technological as well as societal innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore: Use your right to vote to secure an open, democratic, and future-oriented Germany!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We as Doctoral Researchers (DRs) work in a highly competitive environment. In contrast to other professions, our tasks are not clearly defined. Instead, we have the liberty and the responsibility to balance a diverse range of activities such as practical lab work, data analysis, reading papers, writing papers, extracurricular activities, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From time to time, this multitude of tasks can get overwhelming; most of us have experienced this first-hand. However, if this state of high stress prevails over extended durations with no recovery periods, we run the risk of experiencing &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;burnout&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put the term into context, we use the definition by psychologists H. Freudenberger and G. North, who introduced a first framework delineating the twelve stages of burnout in their book from 1992. Each of these stages is characterized by a set of symptoms that individuals may exhibit at the respective progression level. That being said, it is important to acknowledge that experiences and symptom severity may vary from individual to individual. The progression of burnout can manifest subtly and escape immediate recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the stages outlined below can provide orientation for assessing one’s risk of burning out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excessive Ambition:&lt;/strong&gt; Individuals often start with enthusiasm and high ambition. They have high expectations of themselves, aiming to achieve more than they realistically can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Commitment:&lt;/strong&gt; As the pressure to achieve these high-set goals intensifies, individuals push themselves to work harder and take on new tasks, often exceeding their physical and mental limits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neglecting Own Needs:&lt;/strong&gt; In pursuit of their objectives, individuals tend to overlook their own well-being, neglecting essential self-care practices such as adequate sleep, proper nutrition, and relaxation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Displacing (Private) Problems:&lt;/strong&gt; Rather than addressing personal issues or stressors, individuals channel their focus and energy into work, using it to avoid confronting underlying problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revision of Values:&lt;/strong&gt; The continuous stress and strain lead to a reassessment of personal priorities, where work takes precedence over other crucial aspects of life such as health, relationships, and hobbies. Emotional blunting and attention deficits may occur.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Denial of New Problems:&lt;/strong&gt; Even as new stressors arise, individuals may deny their significance or the toll that they take, attempting to persevere despite the mounting burdens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Withdrawal from Relationships:&lt;/strong&gt; Feeling overwhelmed and emotionally drained, individuals start to withdraw from social interactions, isolating themselves and reducing communication with friends, family, and colleagues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact on Others:&lt;/strong&gt; The growing burnout begins to affect not only the individual but also their relationships and interactions with others, causing strain and often altering the dynamics of their personal and professional connections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depersonalization:&lt;/strong&gt; To distance themselves from the stress and emotional cost, individuals may start perceiving themselves and others in a detached, impersonal manner, losing the sense of connection and empathy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inner Emptiness:&lt;/strong&gt; Over time, the persistent burnout leads to a profound sense of emptiness, where the individual struggles to find fulfillment or purpose in their work and/or life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depression:&lt;/strong&gt; The deepening emotional exhaustion and disillusionment can progress into a state of depression, characterized by constant feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities. An intense desire for extended sleep or even suicidal thoughts may develop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Burnout Syndrome:&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, after enduring the various stages of burnout, individuals may reach a point of full burnout, experiencing a complete depletion of physical, emotional, and mental resources. This often requires significant intervention and support to recover from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel like you have already progressed to some of the aforementioned stages, please take a step back. If you realize that one of your colleagues is increasingly displaying visible signs of burnout such as social withdrawal, it would be good to approach them and ask about their current situation. After recognizing burnout, seeking help and practicing self-care are crucial steps for recovery and for maintaining stable mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to realize that burnout is not a sign of weakness, but rather a &lt;strong&gt;natural response&lt;/strong&gt; to overwhelming stress. Talk about your feelings and what you are experiencing with friends and family and/or seek professional help. Do more of what makes you happy and gives you energy. Say “no” more and draw clear boundaries – it may be difficult, but it is an important measure to prevent burnout. You are strong, and you WILL get through this! With time and support, you can find balance and happiness in your life again. And lastly, never forget:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you are not alone&lt;/strong&gt;. :)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Your voice, your advocacy tool</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2024/04/your-voice-your-advocacy-tool/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2024/04/your-voice-your-advocacy-tool/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2024/04/your-voice-your-advocacy-tool/images/Copy-of-Survey-2024-version-2-Blogbanner-2.png" alt="Featured image of post Your voice, your advocacy tool" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;written by Aga Seretny, Speaker Survey 2023&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h5 id="a-guest-entry-by-johannes-krämer-heju-spokesperson-2023"&gt;&lt;em&gt;a guest entry by Johannes Krämer (HeJu Spokesperson 2023)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the state of freedom of science and academia today? The idea of academic freedom dates back long ago, and in short, ascertains that academics can conduct and communicate their research or teach without the fear of repression, job loss, or imprisonment. However, job security and career perspectives have been found to be among the biggest drawbacks of scientific careers in Germany [1]. One important tool to regulate this within the German academic system is the &lt;em&gt;Act on Fixed Term Employment Contracts in Academia&lt;/em&gt; (WissenschaftsZeitVertragsGesetz - WissZeitVG) [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WissZeitVG regulates fixed term contracts. More precisely, it regulates the maximal duration one is allowed to be employed on a fixed term contract in academia. It does not regulate working hours, salaries, vacation days, etc. neither does it explicitly address working conditions, supervision of doctoral researchers, or project funding resources. It does not even regulate extensions, except defining an upper limit for the summed up contract time on fixed term contracts. So what&amp;rsquo;s all the fuss about if it&amp;rsquo;s “only about fixed-term contracts”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the WissZeitVG mainly regulates maximum contract duration, this regulation causes far-reaching consequences for the academic environment. It impacts the structure of research institutions, where a professor and a handful of researchers reside in those limited permanent positions, whereas a large number of postdoctoral researchers, staff scientists, lecturers, and doctoral researchers – the ones, who are performing major parts of the scientific and higher educational work – are employed with fixed term contracts. And yes, for doctoral researchers, this is easily comprehensible, since they work towards a clearly defined qualification goal in order to graduate and then move on to a new chapter of their career. But for postdoctoral researchers, no such clear qualification exists, and they simply gain experience in their field of work, hoping to land one of those rare permanent positions. But it’s not just the structure of working groups, departments, or institutes, the funding system is also tailored to the current constraints given by the WissZeitVG. If these were now changed and all fixed-term contracts for postdoctoral researches were removed instantaneously, this would result in a collapse of the system. There are not enough permanent positions available nowadays and no additional funds to increase these numbers. The other extreme – allowing only unlimited fixed-term contracts in academia – would risk that highly skilled employees remain in uncertainty for their whole working life, always in fear of losing their job and either need to relocate far away from their homes or not finding new employment due to being overqualified. Aspects that can have a negative impact on their productivity and well-being. These and many more aspects need to be taken into account, when discussing the WissZeitVG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evaluation of the WissZeitVG, published in 2022, has shown the need of an amendment to prevent precarious working conditions in academia [3]. Details on the poor functions and precarious conditions in the current system can also be found in the 2021 National Report on Junior Scholars (BuWiN) [4]. Too many chain contracts, the majority of people on fixed-term contracts, and over 85 % leaving academia within 10 years after graduation of their doctorate. The constant fear of losing one’s job or not being able to get a subsequent contract. Not being able to plan one’s career in the long term without depending on fortunate circumstances. Sinking into work in order to perform best in the next evaluation, and putting in countless hours of unpaid overtime to do so. All this makes academia a precarious field of work. Seeing that many doctoral researches still have the ambition to pursue an academic career [5], is at odds with the number of positions available. However, it also shows that researchers are genuinely eager to contribute to science and thus to the benefit of society**.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WissZeitVG needs to give prospects for those who stay in academia, “permanency” on fixed-term contracts may not be the answer to that. Making an academic career more predictable may make it more attractive to those groups, which are currently underrepresented. Females, first-gen academics, and all of those who cannot take the risk to spend many years in precarious conditions or who do not have the financial protection to bridge the time between contracts. On the other hand, leaving academia in a shorter period of time after graduation can be beneficial to proceed with a career outside of academia and gain required experiences there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were able to resolve all questions around the WissZeitVG in a blog post, the ongoing political process of the amendment of the act would not have been as tedious as it is. Finding solutions to problems arising in complex systems is not an easy task: and academia with its heterogeneity is a very complex system indeed. Here, we can only try to illustrate some aspects related to the topic, which might help to find a common ground for further discussions on the law itself. More detailed information on the position of HeJu and other doctoral researcher networks, as well as many other employee representations and unions who came together in a strong alliance can be found in our joint statement [6].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how the new amendment of the WissZeitVG will look like, it can only set the direction for what the academic environment will look like in the future. Many more steps have to be taken. The funding scheme needs to be adjusted accordingly. If fixed-term contracts are allowed for shorter periods, we need more permanent positions, thus, more funding for these types of positions is needed. Since it is unlikely that the total amount of money available for academia will grow strongly as funding remains limited, we need to optimize the selection of people for permanent positions, and accompany them during their careers, starting when they are already students and doctoral researchers. Other options, like the utilization of the regular fixed-term contract act (Teilzeit- und Befristungsgesetz, TzB) for postdoctoral researchers may be taken into account, in particular when being equipped with exceptional conditions as in the case of young investigator group leaders or similar positions. We might even need to reconsider how “&lt;em&gt;permanent”&lt;/em&gt; permanent positions will be. A permanent contract in academia will no longer be understood as a contract for the entire working life. Changing jobs within academia, since permanent positions are no longer the rare win in the lottery, will become normal. Breaking the one-way job transitions from academia to industry - but (almost) never &lt;em&gt;vice versa -&lt;/em&gt; will lead to a more dynamic setting where people change jobs and contribute a broader range of skills. Academia will be benefiting if it adapts to the new rules. In times of skilled workers shortage, we cannot risk losing the best educated. And we need to provide attractive conditions for internationals to shift the brain drain into a brain gain, which will eventually benefit many more areas beside the academic field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, no solution will meet all demands of all stakeholders, but we should not be afraid of substantial changes, if we want to truly improve the working conditions in academia. We shouldn’t make ill-advised decisions, and every possible adjustment of the WissZeitVG opens even more questions, which might need to be answered. Politicians have taken serious efforts to find a solution, which meets the expectations of employers and employees alike. We hope that they will continue to discuss with representatives of doctoral researchers, and listen to their advice as well as to the consultation of other parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last point to keep in mind: The doctoral researchers, as well as Bachelor and Master students of today, are the first generation affected by the amendment of the WissZeitVG. They might be inexperienced in questions of funding schemes and contract details, but they know best how it feels to look into their own future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s create a bright future for those bright minds, so that their academic endeavors are free again and not overshadowed by the fear of the extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day of a doctoral researcher (DR) consists of 9 h of work on average (according to N² Survey 2021). Contracts (or at least the paid part of them) only cover a fraction of that – most contracts cover about 6 h of work per day. Adding stress of having to publish, giving presentations, and other deadlines, the expectations of science do not leave much room for anything beyond. However, the workload of DRs is the biggest inducer of anxiety and followed closely by depression (see figure below). The lack of a good work-life-sleep balance is a key factor for a healthy life in the long run, but seems to be neglected during the doctoral research phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work-life balance is nothing new to me. My stuttering taught me at an early age that I need breaks from stress. If I don’t comply, if I don’t relax, it will just get worse. A simple equation. A simple reflection of my well-being – a reflection that I am not able to hide. That means that I need somewhat more time to relax and can not simply power through stressful periods without worsening my stutter. Current times supervisors expect you to work over 100 %. At the beginning of my doctorate, I tried to comply to it but failed miserably. I found myself at 6 to 7 hours per day – and sometimes extra hours on a Saturday. To that fragile balance I added a spokesperson-ship with the  Helmholtz Juniors&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactions from others were mostly the same: “Oh so you like pain?”, “You will never finish your project when you only look at the contract hours.” or “If you continue your voluntary work, you’ll lose focus for your project”. Being a member of the works council is a good thing, being part of the internal scientific board is an honour, but taking on similar roles as a DR should be kept for your free time or better not taken on at all&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this just made one problem obvious – a missing balance. The qualification phase should not only look at research but to educate academics, future supervisors and leaders. Meaning, most projects are just too big and the result is a high workload which is only manageable with the sacrifice of time one would need to recharge or to educate themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, these sacrifices would be totally avoidable if the qualification phase would not only include time for the project. The time for education, networking and gaining soft skills should not be something for our free time as it is part of the job – not an extra weight on your shoulders. The institute shoves education to the university as its their job to do so. But if I am expected to work 40 and more hours per week on my project, how am I supposed to work on my soft skills as a DR? When do I have time to network when I don`t get the time off to attend events with other DRs? When do I get time to recharge when I have to take vacation for educational courses? When can I relax when I am expected to write reports during my vacation? When does it all make sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An average of &amp;gt;40 h of work per week, an average of 4.5 years until the defence, 41 % of people don’t feel free to take vacation due to high workload or pressure from the supervisors. All these and more are facts among our DRs (according to the N² Survey 2021). Numbers of a missing balance, numbers of imbalance towards work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Covid infection made this imbalance real to me. Out of order for two whole weeks, and my ability to focus vanished for a few more weeks. A full break for everything. Only then, I noticed how bad my stuttering got. I had not focused on myself for months on end, time to recharge always got cut short to finish mails, experiments or presentations. And now I got my limits shown to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who is responsible for the “life” in work life balance? Most institutes don`t care, most universities don`t care, most supervisors don`t care, most group leaders don`t care. It&amp;rsquo;s you. You have to care. Care for yourself. Care for your peers. You have to take the time you need to recharge, take time for education, take time for networking, take what is rightfully yours. It is not your fault the projects are not planned accordingly, but its your responsibility to care for your health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay home when you are sick (check out „Vakanztage“, most institutes have it), go home when you loose focus, go home when you are tired and take your peers with you. Leave your laptop at home for vacation, don`t check mails when you are sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure that the academic imbalance of others does not take your balance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>N² position statement on the draft bill to amend the Act on Fixed Term Employment Contracts in Academia (WissZeitVG)</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2023/07/n-position-statement-on-the-draft-bill-to-amend-the-act-on-fixed-term-employment-contracts-in-academia-wisszeitvg/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2023/07/n-position-statement-on-the-draft-bill-to-amend-the-act-on-fixed-term-employment-contracts-in-academia-wisszeitvg/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;send by BMBF on 14.06.2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, N2, the network of networks, the representatives of the doctoral researchers of the three non-university research institutions, the Helmholtz Association, the Max Planck Society and the Leibniz Association, welcome the efforts of the BMBF to create better conditions for researchers and academics with the presented draft for a new version of the German fixed term contract WissZeitVG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indispensable for this is the incorporation of the experience of scientific personnel at all career levels. Their diverse backgrounds must also be sufficiently taken into account. Therefore, we present our statement in both German and English, and would welcome this approach from all parties involved in the discourse around WissZeitVG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present draft bill already contains some promising changes. We welcome the introduction of minimum terms for initial contracts allowing for longer-term planning at the beginning of each phase. The expansion of the compensation for disadvantages and the consideration of care can create windows of flexibility in these vulnerable areas and benefit diversity in science. All of these steps contribute to a better work environment and safety and would make Germany more attractive for (international) researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we feel like a wide range of problems that have been addressed in the evaluation of the WissZeitVG and extensively discussed with several stakeholders, including us, still remain unanswered. In alliance with initially ten organizations and now many more supporters, we have already formulated a statement with clear demands for an amendment of the WissZeitVG[1]. We would like to underline that the following points need to be reconsidered and enter the reformed act:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standard duration of six years, and a minimum of four years for doctoral contracts!&lt;/strong&gt; While three years minimum contract duration is already an improvement, this does not yet correspond to the actual duration required for the successful completion of a doctorate, shown by several surveys like the BuWiN and the harmonized N2 survey 2021. With a minimum term of the initial contract of four years and a standard term of six years, the law would better reflect reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narrowing down the concept of qualification to the doctorate!&lt;/strong&gt; In the existing version of the WissZeitVG, the concept of qualification is not a legally secure formulation (shown for example by the BAG verdict on the 02.02.2022). The present draft does not make any changes to this, and will thus not make it possible to guarantee legally secure fixed term employment for both doctoral researcher and postdocs in the future either. Thus, the practice of using the WissZeitVG to employ scientists on fixed-term contracts with vague qualification goals to fulfill permanent tasks, including doctoral researchers who have to work on tasks not related to their thesis, will continue. Only a narrowing of the concept of qualification to the doctorate and clearly defined qualification goals and contract requirements for doctoral candidates can change this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long periods of fixed term contracts for postdocs need to stop!&lt;/strong&gt; With the doctorate, the ability for fully independent work in academia is not always well-established. Also, different disciplines have very different requirements to achieve this. Therefore, we understand the motivation of the BMBF to design the postdoc phase with four years on a fixed term employment and additional two years, in case of a permanency assurance, which allows for example for a habilitation. Nevertheless, we must point out that the reform of the WissZeitVG cannot allow existing practices to continue, but must bring about an improvement. First and foremost, a long period of short term chain contracts and the first permanent position at an age over 40 years[2] hinders secure career and famliy planning. Also, not every scientific career has to end and can end in a professorship, and this goal does not have to be achieved exclusively by fixed-term positions. While the minimum contract period of two years serves the purpose of orientation, longer fixed-term periods without binding and comprehensible commitments run the risk of enabling abuse of postdocs for handling permanent tasks and hinder their career progress. Particularly with regard to the attractiveness of science compared to the non-academic labor market, this sends a devastating signal and damages the aspiration to be able to compete internationally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complete lifting of the tariff ban!&lt;/strong&gt; The separation of science from the rest of the labor market due to the partial continuation of the tariff ban represents an incomprehensible special position. The suggested partial removal only harms the employees’ side by reducing the minimum duration of contracts and does not allow for establishing transparent career progress goals or even extension criteria. Without the ability to negotiate on key factors, working conditions will worsen and make working in science and higher education unattractive and eventually drive brilliant minds out of academia or Germany.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full compensation for all disadvantages&lt;/strong&gt;! Despite the improvements in the draft bill, the family and social policy components have not yet been expanded far enough. The inclusion of a care component is highly appreciated and will be of great importance in an increasingly aging society. However, compensations must apply to all employees under the WissZeitVG without exception. Not only those with a qualification reasoned fixed-term, but also those with third party funded fixed term employment, in particular if used to exceed the qualification time limit, need to benefit from these compensations. This is crucial in order to meet the special challenges of this particularly challenged group of employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demands of student employee representatives need to be met!&lt;/strong&gt; The increase of the fixed term for student employees (SHK) from six to eight years and the introduction of minimum contract terms of one year are already a big step in the right direction. Nevertheless, they do not yet meet the demands of the representatives of student employees and we advise to continue to seek dialogue with them in order to do justice to another strongly underrepresented group in the discussions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An amendment of the WissZeitVG alone cannot renew the location of science (Wissenschaftsstandort Deutschland). The creation of permanent positions must now be included in the negotiation of funds. Further efforts must also be made to improve working conditions in science. These include the fair remuneration of doctoral researchers who still work in part-time employment and are not compensated for the additional work needed to fulfill the scope of their tasks. In order to be competitive and to not further aggravate the shortage of qualified workers, this must change. The practice of scholarships must also be questioned in order to counteract inequality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only through a determined joint effort from all sides can we continue to sustainably develop Germany as an attractive research location in the coming years and attract future generations to science, starting with today&amp;rsquo;s doctoral researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us are familiar with the famous Roman saying “Mens sana in corpore sano”, which could be translated into “a healthy mind in a healthy body”, and almost sure there is a translation in your native language in case Latin nor English is one of them. This reflects the fact that even in ancient times the health of the mind was as important as the health of the body. But at some point, that shifted. Mental problems became something to be hidden or neglected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why mental health was long disregarded in discussions of health is the stigma attached to mental illness. The stigmatization of mental illness has been pervasive and long-standing in many cultures, often leading to individuals suffering in silence and not seeking help. Unfortunately, this is particularly true in academia, where the pressure to succeed, the competition for funding and positions, and the constant need to publish can all take a toll on one&amp;rsquo;s mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academia is known for its culture of perfectionism, where mental toughness is often equated with success. This mindset can lead individuals to ignore their mental health needs and feel ashamed or weak for experiencing mental health challenges by fearing judgment or discrimination from their colleagues and peers if they talk about their mental health struggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stigma can have severe consequences, such as deterring individuals from seeking help, delaying diagnosis and treatment, and ultimately harming their overall health. To combat it, it is crucial to normalize discussions around mental health and acknowledge that challenges related to it are common and natural in academia. Seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universities and academic institutions should prioritize resources and offer support for their students and staff. Mental health support should be easily accessible, affordable, and destigmatized. Additionally, research institutions should promote mental health awareness and provide education around to reduce the stigmatization of it and broaden its understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also crucial to encourage open communication and support between colleagues and peers. Academic institutions should promote a culture of support and encourage individuals to share their mental health struggles with others, as sometimes building connections and empathize could help to ease the struggles. This can help reduce feelings of isolation and create a sense of community among those struggling with mental health challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academic institutions should also recognize and acknowledge the impact of academic stress and pressure on mental health. High-pressure academic environments can exacerbate existing mental health conditions or even create new ones. Therefore, it is essential to create a supportive and nurturing environment that prioritizes mental health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these and other reasons it that we as HeJus would like to contribute to this ongoing discussion and generate awareness during this month. Along it, we will be sharing content related to Mental Health that you will be able to find in the survey and well as our social media channels. So, remember to take care of yourself and your fellow doctoral researchers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Für eine umfassende Reform des Wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetzes</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2023/03/f%C3%BCr-eine-umfassende-reform-des-wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetzes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2023/03/f%C3%BCr-eine-umfassende-reform-des-wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetzes/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2023/03/f%C3%BCr-eine-umfassende-reform-des-wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetzes/images/Joingt-Statment-WissZeitVG-170323-5.png" alt="Featured image of post Für eine umfassende Reform des Wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetzes" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The English translation is intended to make the content accessible to international stakeholders, but does not claim to be accurate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For a major reform of the Fixed-Term Academic Contract Act (Wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetz, WissZeitVG)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joint statement by employee and student representatives on the Key Issues Paper of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research dated 17.03.2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost one year after the publication of the evaluation report on the amendment of the Fixed-Term Academic Contract Act (WissZeitVG), and after a large number of stakeholder discussions (including with us), the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) has presented an initial key issues paper on the reform of the Act. We welcome this step, but are disappointed with the content: &lt;strong&gt;the proposals at best alleviate the symptoms of the fixed-term system, but do not promise a cure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting appropriate, binding and concrete minimum contract periods, especially for initial contracts, and curbing chain contracts are important contributions to the necessary reform. But in the proposed compromises on maximum term limits, &lt;strong&gt;the original reason for reforming the law&lt;/strong&gt; again has faded into the background: &lt;strong&gt;the lack of predictability of academic careers, both before and after the doctorate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial reactions to the key issues paper have once again clearly shown that &lt;strong&gt;a comprehensive and well thought-out strategy is needed to create more permanent positions, fair and gender-equitable employment conditions, and predictable career paths for lecturers and researchers in the German higher education and research system&lt;/strong&gt;. How this goal is to be achieved, however, remains unclear, even in many contributions to the debate that has now broken out. Last year, we already presented key points that pursue a holistic, clear approach and take into account both the interests of the employees we represent and the performance of the higher education and research system. This approach is currently more justified than ever. Contrary to the frequently claimed disagreement about the necessary reform steps, it must be emphasized once again that we, as &lt;strong&gt;a broad alliance of employee representatives, are taking a common position.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We demand…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;for the doctoral phase, six years of standard contract duration, but at least four years of contract duration&lt;/strong&gt;, legally designed as a &lt;em&gt;Must&lt;/em&gt; rather than a &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; clause. The average doctoral period of 5.7 years (Federal Report on Young Academics, BuWiN) has not changed, not least because of the current practice of insufficient initial contract lengths and non-transparent criteria for contract extensions. In order to work in parallel towards the goal of shorter doctoral periods, better framework conditions must be created. This includes not only an appropriate contract structure that guarantees qualification during working hours, but also better structural support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a clear narrowing of the term qualification to the doctorate&lt;/strong&gt; in order to put an end to the gratuitous practice of fixed-term contracts. This will not only prevent possible abuse of fixed-term contracts, but also provide legal certainty for universities and research institutions as well as employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;for the phase after the doctorate&lt;/strong&gt;, either &lt;strong&gt;permanent employment&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;temporary employment with the promise of extension of the contract for an indefinite period of time upon fulfillment of specified requirements&lt;/strong&gt;. The qualification for remaining in the science system is completed with the doctorate; at this point, the universities and research institutions must decide to whom they can offer a permanent perspective. If permanent employment does not follow immediately after the doctorate, a plannable path to a permanent position must be opened up and clearly defined. Simply poking around at the maximum term limit, as proposed in the BMBF&amp;rsquo;s key points paper of March 17, 2023, is counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the &lt;strong&gt;deletion of the collective bargaining block unconditionally&lt;/strong&gt;. As in other sectors, unions and employers in science and humanities must have the right to restrict fixed-term employment contracts to a comprehensible level in a collective agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;uniform and binding regulations on compensation for disadvantages&lt;/strong&gt; in the case of childcare, disability and chronic illness as well as disadvantages resulting from the corona pandemic. The existing legal entitlement to an extension of contract in the case of maternity leave, parental leave, leave to care for relatives, and leave to work as an equal opportunity representative or member of a staff committee &lt;strong&gt;must also apply&lt;/strong&gt; without restriction &lt;strong&gt;in the case of third-party funding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a standard contract period of at least two years for student assistants&lt;/strong&gt;, as has functioned smoothly in Berlin for many years. The proposals of the BMBF cornerstone paper to improve the situation of student assistants are to be acknowledged, but unfortunately not sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, a considerable share of fixed-term contracts is due to third-party funding. Such a large share is neither in the sense of qualification nor in the sense of sustainable research, teaching and personnel development. This problem cannot be solved by amending the WissZeitVG. Instead, &lt;strong&gt;the federal and state governments must change the funding structure for universities and research and significantly increase the share of basic funding&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, universities and research institutions are called upon to use third-party pooling to create more permanent positions in the area of third-party funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We call on the BMBF to further develop its key points into guidelines for a comprehensive reform of the Fixed-Term Academic Contract Act in line with our joint statement and to prepare a corresponding draft bill without delay.&lt;/p&gt;

Plädoyer für eine Reform des Befristungsrechts - ein gemeinsames Statement
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Die Wissenschaft in Deutschland ist in einer Krise und merkt es nicht. Es ist eine Krise des verschwendeten Potenzials ‒ eine Krise, die auf Kosten derjenigen ausgetragen wird, die das System maßgeblich tragen: der Wissenschaftler:innen ohne Professur. Unsicherheit und Zukunftsängste, Stress und zugespitzte Abhängigkeitsverhältnisse prägen den Alltag von Wissenschaft als Beruf. Obwohl inzwischen der Großteil von Forschung und Lehre von Wissenschaftler:innen ohne Professur gestemmt wird, sind verlässliche Arbeitsverhältnisse und berechenbare Perspektiven in der Regel nur für Professor:innen vorgesehen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wie produktiv könnte unsere Wissenschaft sein, wenn sie das Potenzial, das in unserem wissenschaftlichen Personal steckt, voll heben würde?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wissenschaft ist nicht zuletzt Denkarbeit, Experimentieren und kritisches Hinterfragen. Doch das braucht Zeit ‒ und lässt sich mit Hektik und Zukunftsangst nur unter Qualitätsverlusten und Selbstausbeutung verbinden. Die Eigenheiten des akademischen Karriereweges betreffen dabei nicht alle gleich. Nach wie vor haben Machtverhältnisse anhand von Faktoren wie race, class, gender und abilty einen prägenden Einfluss auf Zugänge, Berufswege und Karrierechancen in der Wissenschaft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Die Arbeitsverhältnisse der Promovierenden und Postdocs werden heute überwiegend nach dem Wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetz (WissZeitVG) geregelt. Dieses Gesetz wurde 2016 novelliert und der Einfluss dieser Novelle auf die Arbeitsverhältnisse in mehreren (im letzten Monat) publizierten Studien untersucht. Die Ergebnisse sind ernüchternd: Eine Trendwende hin zu mehr unbefristeten Arbeitsverhältnissen ist ausgeblieben, der Anteil der Kurzzeitverträge mit Laufzeiten von einem Jahr oder weniger wurde nicht nachhaltig reduziert. Qualifikationszeiten sind von den Vertragslaufzeiten nicht annähernd gedeckt. Die Instrumente des Nachteilsausgleichs entfalten keine verlässliche Wirkung. Die unterzeichnenden Organisationen sind deshalb überzeugt, dass jetzt eine mutige und grundlegende Reform des Sonderbefristungsrechts für die Wissenschaft notwendig ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eckpunkte für mehr Planbarkeit und Chancengleichheit der Berufswege in der Wissenschaft:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Der Qualifizierungsbegriff im WissZeitVG muss eng geführt und juristisch bindend definiert werden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eine Anstellung zur Promotion kann eine Befristung begründen. Für andere Qualifizierungsziele als Begründung für eine befristete Beschäftigung sehen wir in dieser Phase keine Berechtigung.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mit dem Eintritt in die Postdoc-Phase sollte in der Regel ein unbefristeter Arbeitsvertrag oder zumindest ein planbares Verfahren zur Entfristung in der Wissenschaft verbunden sein. Beschäftigte, deren Arbeit von Daueraufgaben geprägt ist, müssen auf Dauerstellen beschäftigt werden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vertragslaufzeiten müssen den angestrebten Qualifikationszielen entsprechen. Wie die Evaluationen eindrucksvoll zeigen, ist dies nicht der Fall: Mittlere effektive Vertragslaufzeiten bei Promovierenden von etwa 20 Monaten bei einer durchschnittlichen Promotionszeit von 4,7 Jahren (vgl. Bundesbericht Wissenschaftlicher Nachwuchs 2021) zeigen, dass die WissZeitVG-Novelle von 2016, an ihren eigenen Zielen gemessen, gescheitert ist. Die durchschnittlichen Qualifizierungszeiten sollten daher fächerspezifisch regelmäßig erhoben werden, um auf dieser Grundlage verbindliche Vorgaben zu machen. Unverbindliche Gesetzesformulierungen sind offenkundig nicht ausreichend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verlängerungen der Höchstbefristungsdauer (§ 2 Absatz 1 Sätze 4-6 WissZeitVG) führen, wie die Evaluation gezeigt hat, bisher kaum zu faktischen Vertragsverlängerungen und sollten als Rechtsansprüche der Beschäftigten neu ausgestaltet werden. Verlängerungsansprüche sollten hierbei für alle Beschäftigten zugänglich sein, die mit dem Ziel angestellt werden, eine Qualifizierung zu absolvieren.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Die Tarifsperre muss aufgehoben werden. Nur beim Thema Befristung in der Wissenschaft ist den Sozialpartnern durch das Arbeitsrecht verboten, wesentliche Fragen der Arbeitsbedingungen tariflich zu regeln. Dies steht im eklatanten Widerspruch zum im Koalitionsvertrag verankerten Ziel der Bundesregierung, die Tarifautonomie zu stärken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Das deutsche Wissenschaftssystem ist in einer solchen Krise, scheint es jedoch nicht zu merken. Es ist eine Krise des verschwendeten Potenzials, eine Krise, die auf Kosten derjenigen ausgetragen wird, die das System tragen. Die Wissenschaft in Deutschland erscheint nach außen kontinuierlich und verlässlich, aber hinter dieser Fassade sind die Probleme gravierend. So leiden etwa Promovierende überproportional häufig an depressiven Symptomen (unsere Studien: &lt;a class="link" href="https://leibniz-phd.net/survey-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Leibniz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz.de/karriere/karriere-bei-helmholtz/promovierende/helmholtz-juniors/survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Helmholtz&lt;/a&gt; und &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.phdnet.mpg.de/145345/2_PhDnet_Survey_Report_2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Max-Planck&lt;/a&gt;). Diese Promovierenden sind das unbestrittene Rückgrat des deutschen Wissenschaftssystems. Auch bilden  sie zusammen mit den Postdocs die Mehrheit des wissenschaftlichen Personals. Trotzdem werden ihre Bedürfnisse, Sorgen und Ängste vergleichsweise wenig bei der Gestaltung der Strukturen und Organisationskultur in der Wissenschaft berücksichtigt. So bleibt viel Potenzial ungenutzt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wie produktiv könnte unsere Forschung sein, wenn das System seinem wissenschaftlichen Personal ein angemessenes Arbeitsumfeld bieten würde? Wie viel Potenzial könnte dann ausgeschöpft werden?&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wissenschaft ist in erster Linie harte Denkarbeit. Doch insbesondere das Denken wird negativ von Unsicherheit und Zukunftsängsten beeinflusst. Die Arbeitsverhältnisse der Promovierenden und Postdocs werden heutzutage überwiegend nach dem WissZeitVG geregelt -einem Gesetz, das die Rahmenbedingung für die Befristung der Arbeitsverhältnisse von Wissenschaftlern gestalten soll. 2016 wurde dieses Gesetz novelliert und heute wurde die Evaluation dieser Novelle publiziert (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bmbf.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/de/2022/abschlussbericht-evaluation-wisszeitvg.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;amp;v=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Evaluationsbericht&lt;/a&gt;). Die primäre Begründung für die Befristung im WissZeitVG ist die “Qualifikation”, ein Begriff der jedoch juristisch nicht näher definiert ist. Das ist auch schon das Kernproblem dieses Gesetzes. Die meisten Einrichtungen (56.8%) haben keinerlei Leitlinien für Qualifizierungsziele entwickelt (Abb. 10 des Evaluationsberichts). Dass die Promotion eine Qualifikationsphase ist, halten wir für unbestreitbar. Doch schon in der Postdoc-Phase ist dies schwieriger zu definieren. In den meisten Fällen wird darum auf die Habilitation als Begründung zurückgegriffen (56%, Tab. 13 des Evaluationsberichts). In Anbetracht der Tatsache, dass die wenigsten von ihnen eine Professur erhalten können (max. 3% der Postdocs), erscheint dies jedoch absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Das primäre Ziel der Novellierung des WissZeitVG 2016 war es “unsachgemäße Kurzbefristungen” zu unterbinden und verlässliche Rahmenbedingungen für die Befristungen von Arbeitsverträgen zu schaffen. Dieses Ziel wurde leider nicht erreicht. Nach einer kurzfristigen Verlängerung der mittleren effektiven Vertragslaufzeiten (durchschnittlichen Vertragslaufzeiten) von 2015 bis 2017, sind diese von 2017 bis 2020 auf den Vornovellierungs-Zustand zurückgefallen. Im Fall des promovierten Personals der AuF (Außeruniversitäre Forschungseinrichtungen) und HAW (Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaften), sind im Zeitraum zwischen 2015 und 2020 die mittleren eff. Vertragslaufzeiten sogar zurückgegangen (Abb. 1). Die vereinbarten Vertragslaufzeiten sind auch für die Promovierenden nicht angemessen. Die mittleren effektiven Laufzeiten liegen Organisationsübergreifend bei etwa 20 Monaten, wobei die Durchschnittliche Dauer einer Promotion in Deutschland 4.7 Jahre, also 55 Monate, beträgt (&lt;a class="link" href="https://buwin.de/dateien/buwin-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Buwin&lt;/a&gt;; Abb. B46). Insgesamt zeigt diese Evaluation, dass die unsachgemäße Befristungsdauer von Arbeitsverträgen nach wie vor die Norm in der Wissenschaft ist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://blogs.helmholtz.de/hejus/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2022/05/Layout-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Abb. 1 - Mittlere effektive Vertragslaufzeiten des nach WissZeitVG angestellten Personals. Die Daten wurden aus den Tabellen 9-12 entnommen.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projektlaufzeiten von Drittmittelprojekten sind im Allgemeinen wesentlich länger als die entsprechenden Arbeitsverträge (Abb. 58 des Evaluationsberichts). Damit gehen die Arbeitgeber nicht ihrer Verpflichtung nach, die ihnen nach WissZeitVG §2 Absatz 2  auferlegt wird, denn dort heißt es, die “&lt;/p&gt;
\[...\]&lt;p&gt; vereinbarte Befristungsdauer soll dem bewilligten Projektzeitraum entsprechen”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diese schlecht planbaren und unsicheren Arbeitsbedingungen führen zu Zukunftssorgen, Selbstausbeutung und in der Konsequenz zu psychischen Belastungen für Promovierende wie Postdocs. Viele kluge Köpfe verlassen in der Folge die Wissenschaft und nehmen ihre Ideen und Methoden mit. Diese Lücken werden sich bemerkbar machen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welches Potential steckt also in unseren wissenschaftlichen Institutionen? Wir wissen es nicht! Für gute Forschung müssen gute Grundlagen geschaffen werden. Im Anbetracht der Schwierigkeiten, die uns im 21sten Jahrhundert beschäftigen werden und schon jetzt beschäftigen, brauchen wir den bestmöglichen wissenschaftlichen Apparat.

The German scientific system is in such a crisis but does not seem to recognize it. It’s a crisis of wasted potential, a crisis to the detriment of those who help to carry the system. From the outside, science in Germany appears to be continuous and reliable, but this façade only hides serious problems. For example, Doctoral Researchers (henceforth DRs) disproportionately often suffer from depressive symptoms (our studies: &lt;a class="link" href="https://leibniz-phd.net/survey-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Leibniz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz.de/karriere/karriere-bei-helmholtz/promovierende/helmholtz-juniors/survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Helmholtz&lt;/a&gt; und &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.phdnet.mpg.de/145345/2_PhDnet_Survey_Report_2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Max-Planck&lt;/a&gt;). These DRs are the undisputed backbone of the German scientific system. Moreover, together with Postdocs, they compose the majority of scientific staff. Nonetheless, their needs, worries and fears find comparatively little consideration when it comes to the design of structures and organizational culture in science. This way, a lot of potential remains unused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How productive could our research be if the system granted its scientific staff an adequate working environment? How much potential could we utilize?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science is primarily mental work. But especially mental capacities are negatively impacted by uncertainty and anxiety about the future. Currently and in most cases, the working conditions of DRs and Postdocs are regulated by the WissZeitVG -a law that is meant to set the general framework for scientists’ temporary employment conditions. In 2016, this law was amended and today the evaluation of this amendment has been published (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bmbf.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/de/2022/abschlussbericht-evaluation-wisszeitvg.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;amp;v=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;evaluation report&lt;/a&gt;). The primary justification for any temporary contract according to the WissZeitVG is “qualification”, a term which is, however, legally not closer defined. And that’s already this law’s core issue. Most institutions (56.8%) have not developed any guidelines for qualification goals (Figure 10 of the evaluation report). We do not doubt that the time of doing a doctorate is a qualification phase. However, when scientists enter the Postdoc phase, it is already more difficult to define the qualification goals.  For that matter, in most cases, habilitation is used as justification (56%, Table 13 of the evaluation report). This appears absurd considering that only a minority of those scientists can receive a professorship (max. 3% of Postdocs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary goal of the WissZeitVG 2016 amendment was to prohibit “inappropriate short-term contracts” and to create a reliable framework for the limitation of work contracts. Unfortunately, this goal has not been reached. After a brief period of time (2015 - 2017), in which average effective contract durations became longer, there appeared to be a relapse from 2017 to 2020 such that contract durations went back to the same level that was observed prior to the amendment. In case of PhD staff of non-academic science organizations (AuF) and of the university of applied sciences (HAW), average contract durations even decreased from 2015 to 2020 (Figure 1). The stipulated contract durations are not appropriate for DRs either. In their case, average effective contract durations are at 20 months regardless of the organization, even though the average doctoral research project actually takes 4.7 years, thus 55 months, in Germany (&lt;a class="link" href="https://buwin.de/dateien/buwin-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Buwin&lt;/a&gt;; Abb. B46). In sum, this evaluation depicts that inappropriate short-term contracts are still the norm in science.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durations of projects financed through third parties usually are longer than the respective work contracts (Figure 58 of the evaluation report). Therefore, employers are not fulfilling their duty, which is specified in WissZeitVG §2 Passage 2, where it says that the &amp;ldquo;[&amp;hellip;] stipulated contract duration shall correspond to the project duration&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These poorly projectable and uncertain working conditions lead to anxiety about the future, self-exploitation and, eventually, to psychological stress for DRs and Postdocs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequence is that many clever minds are leaving science, taking their ideas and methods with them. The holes they leave behind will become noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which potential is hiding in our scientific institutions? We don’t know! To allow for good research, a good foundation needs to be set. In light of the challenges, which will concern us in the 21st century, and already concern us, we need the best possible scientific apparatus. This starts with the scientific staff and their working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

Gorenflos López (FMP Berlin and advisory board member of the WissZeitVG evaluation)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>It’s all about the data!</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2021/09/its-all-about-the-data/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2021/09/its-all-about-the-data/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2021/09/its-all-about-the-data/images/survey.png" alt="Featured image of post It’s all about the data!" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to research in sciences, it&amp;rsquo;s all about the data. We conduct experiments, questionnaires, fieldtrips, or models, spend many hours in the lab or in front of the computer, or whatever other way there is to gather data. From high-pressure/high-temperature experiments with just a handful of data points to big data cancer modelling– solid data is always the ground stone for our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why we, the Helmholtz Juniors, conduct a large, German-wide survey in cooperation with the Max-Planck PhDnet, IPP Mainz PhD Network and the Leibnitz PhD network every two years. This year, the TU Munich is also participating in the survey. Such a database enables us to change the working conditions of every doctoral researcher (DR) within the network or even in Germany in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why do we need every single DR to fill out the survey?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Helmholtz Juniors alone combine about 8,000 DRs under their name (as of 2017). Together with the other three PhD networks we form the network of networks – N², summing up to a total of about 16,000 doctoral researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year about 30% of the DRs participated, which means about 4,800 DRs filled out the whole survey. That’s quite good considering the sheer number of DRs, but still like a puzzle that’s not continued with many pieces missing just because you can see the bigger picture; a lot of details get lost in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s why this year, we have the goal of 50% participation rate: to see more detail, to allow statistical outliers become patterns, to make our analysis and interpretations even more underpinned than last surveys. But to achieve this, we need every opinion that there is, every possible outcome of the survey, every piece of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#RaceTo50&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s the topic?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last 1 ½ years were especially hard for all of us. No field work, no coffee with the colleagues, no chat about your ideas in the hallway, long waiting lists for analysis time, no networking with international colleagues on conferences, no barbeque with the newcomers, isolating conditions of home office, screwed up work-life-sleep balance, …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covid-19 did affect all of us, exacerbated worries that already existed and producing a cohort of worried DRs concerned about completion and quality of their work, worried about their career path and options, worried about their future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s survey will have a bunch of questions about your life and your work during the pandemic, impacts on social environment, navigation of a doctoral thesis, emotional, technological and logistical problems that came up and multiple other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the thing is, everyone of us had different problems. We do not see or hear everything. There are just too many factors that can change everything, too many variables, too many mutual dependent conditions. And that’s why we want to hear about your life adjustments, your problems, your ideas to amend the situation: to figure out typical phenomena, reoccurring patterns, intersecting sets of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And what’s the use of this effort?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This survey is indeed a huge effort. It takes a long time to prepare it (props to our Survey Team!) as well as to evaluate it – not considering the amount of time summing up all the 30 min of filling out a survey from thousands of participating DRs. So why do we stem all this work? Easy: to make a change!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past results have been featured in press conferences and published in journals, newspapers, blogs, and radio stations all over Germany and worldwide. Examples are the Tagesspiegel, Deutschlandfunk or the podcast SWR2 Wissen. A summary of the results was even published in Nature. These publications got us an invitation to the Bundestag as experts and meetings with the Federal Ministers of Education and Research (BMBF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means the problems of our DRs, your problems, get attention in the highest institutions of Germany and the scientific community in general. This fact is encouraging us to go forward with all the voices we can gather and change the world of young researchers for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But therefore, we need the data, we need all voices, we need your voice.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Meet our new HeJu working group speakers – Anna Kilanowski (Survey), Arne Bublitz (Communication), Diego Ortiz (Working-Conditions) and Thore Sager (Events)</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2021/04/meet-our-new-heju-working-group-speakers-anna-kilanowski-survey-arne-bublitz-communication-diego-ortiz-working-conditions-and-thore-sager-events/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2021/04/meet-our-new-heju-working-group-speakers-anna-kilanowski-survey-arne-bublitz-communication-diego-ortiz-working-conditions-and-thore-sager-events/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2021/04/meet-our-new-heju-working-group-speakers-anna-kilanowski-survey-arne-bublitz-communication-diego-ortiz-working-conditions-and-thore-sager-events/images/Meet-WGS-2.png" alt="Featured image of post Meet our new HeJu working group speakers – Anna Kilanowski (Survey), Arne Bublitz (Communication), Diego Ortiz (Working-Conditions) and Thore Sager (Events)" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;During our HeJu annual meeting 2021 (online) on 28th Jan, we elected our new HeJu &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz.de/en/jobs-talent/science/phd-candidates/helmholtz-juniors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

Our HeJu survey team explains you the motivation and execution of our 2019 HeJu survey" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a doctoral researcher (DR) can sometimes lead us to a &amp;ldquo;solitary&amp;rdquo; journey. For instance, even within the same discipline, the researches we do still need certain extent of novelty so that many of us might never find some one doing exactly the same thing and have an in-depth chat about our passions. On the other hand, being doctoral researchers can also bring us a solidary benefit. We are that many (even within the Helmholtz society, there are currently about 8,500 DRs) and the greater challenges (beyond our specific research topic) are so similar for all of us (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03459-7%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03459-7)&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, staying connected with our peer DRs through networks as well as showing the representative status quo of our DR community is crucial to improve our living/working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is an example we have done as Helmholtz Juniors (HeJu) for showing our representative status quo of our DRs. We conduct a Helmholtz-wide PhD survey every two years and publish the results. We also communicate with the administrative units at each center by our local HeJu representatives and try to promote the living/working conditions for our DRs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;German Research Centre for Geosciences, by PR department (Send to us by Bernhard)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would you describe your institute?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences is the national research centre for Earth sciences. Our research focuses on the geosphere within the highly complex System Earth with its further subsystems, its interacting subcycles, and its wide network of cause-and-effect chains. This we do in a close interdisciplinary collaboration with the related scientific disciplines physics, mathematics, chemistry, and biology as well as with the engineering sciences disciplines of rock mechanics, engineering hydrology and seismology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the most interesting results or topics of your work/institute (in the last 3-5 years)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to say as there is plenty of extremly interesting stuff ranging from identifying tiny ancient fragments of a „lost continent“ called Mauritia to the GRACE mission which has tripled its lifetime and yielded extremely valuable data on Earth&amp;rsquo;s gravity field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What makes your institute special among others in the same field?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several things make us special. First, we combine many disciplines from chemistry, biology, physiks to mathematics and of course all sorts of geosciences. Then, secondly, we are large and run many observatories world-wide, eg. our GEOFON network or our geo-magnetic observatories. Third, we are extremely well connected in the Berlin-Brandenburg region as well as in Europe and overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What characteristics should a doctoral researcher have to become a successful scientist in your field and/or in general?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stamina, curiosity, and quite a stable stomach as the food on field trips is sometimes rather special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your special advice for doctoral researchers and young scientists?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do it, and talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>5 Questions: Helmholtz Center Munich</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/11/5-questions-helmholtz-center-munich/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/11/5-questions-helmholtz-center-munich/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/11/5-questions-helmholtz-center-munich/images/HMGU-1.png" alt="Featured image of post 5 Questions: Helmholtz Center Munich" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new series of the blog, we ask 5 questions to personalities of every Helmholtz centres to learn more about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)      How would you describe your institute?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The HMGU is centered on environmental health topic. Thus, research at HMGU addresses the question if and how environmental factors, including environmental pollutants, diet, and lifestyle, interact with our genetic makeup and which interactions lead to severe human diseases, most notably diabetes, lung disease and allergies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2)      What are the most interesting results or topics of your work/institute (in the last 3-5 years)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major achievements have been made in the development of novel therapeutic and prognostic strategies for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the establishment of optoacoustic technologies and the implementation of high throughput data mining and analysis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3)      What makes your institute special among others in the same field?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The HMGU by now comprises one of the internationally leading centers in metabolism research with a particular strength in diabetes, genetics and target development.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4)      What characteristics should a doctoral researcher have to become a successful scientist in your field and/or in general?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivation and dedication to a certain topic, ability to communicate and interact with other people, ability to organize yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5)      What is your special advice for doctoral researchers and young scientists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Select your research topics according to what you are excited about. Only then, you will be motivated and successful in the end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Life after the PhD</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/09/life-after-the-phd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/09/life-after-the-phd/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/09/life-after-the-phd/images/Helmholtz_Submarke_Juniors_RGB-e1506676317274.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Life after the PhD" /&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;div class="chroma"&gt;
&lt;table class="lntable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="lnt"&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="lntd"&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"&gt;&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="cl"&gt;Today we host a post from Tatyana Dubich, head of the Communication Team.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started my PhD project, I saw just one way to go: get a PhD, go ahead as a postdoc with a goal to become professor one day. There was no other life after PhD I could imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time a good friend of mine, a postdoc, confronted me with a statement, that based on the number of people who stay in academia 10 years after graduation, professorship is, in fact, an “alternative” career. I thought that he must be wrong. However, while I progressed with my studies I realized that my naive thinking indeed doesn’t pass the reality check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It became clear that there are too many people with a doctorate degree and too few academic openings. In their study, Larson and colleagues applied populational approach and calculated a “birth rate” for PhD, which turned to be far too high. They concluded that only 12,8% of PhD graduates can attain academic positions in USA. More optimistic prognosis was published by Jordan Weissmann based on National Science Foundation&amp;rsquo;s data in 2013. Although amount of PhDs who found a job in academia vary as much as 5-45% depending on the field of study they averaged at 19,4%.Indeed, my postdoc friend was right. The studies show that the chances to get a tenured-tracked position are pretty grim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the recent study, conducted by  Kahn and Ginther, about 80% of PhDs continue their studies as a postdoc, but only 21% of postdocs actually get a tenured-track positions ten years after PhD. Postdoc training is important for those who would like to pursue tenured-track position despite of all the odds. However, it might not be beneficial for those who chose a career outside academia. The study show that the postdocs who moved to industry, government or non-profit organization earn 17-21% less in 15 years, than their colleagues, who skipped postdoc stage and moved to working force directly after PhD. The data suggest that working experience is more valuable than post-doc training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means that you have to make your career choice early enough and plan your steps accordingly, rather then just go with the flow. Is professorship the only option? Clearly, not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I make a choice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the midterm meeting of the Helmholtz Juniors, Otmar Wiestler, the president of the helmholtz association, mentioned that, in order to find the best fit, one should take into account three major components - personal goal, passion and qualification. I was moved by the advice. Indeed, the formula seems to be rather straightforward: follow your dreams and do what you’re good at. But how do I know, if I my qualification is good enough to a specific job, if it will help me to achieve my personal goal or fulfill my passions? Those points aren’t usually a part of a job description.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science Careers developed a tool to help you measure your goals, passions and qualification and compare it with characteristics needed for specific careers, which I found extremely helpful. myIDP is designed specifically for users with doctoral degree in science and gives a set of non-academic careers one could pursue. It provides an extensive literature overview on every selected career path and gives you an idea, that are the possibilities, challenges and how to get started with one or another profession. It is a good way to get an idea for career development, if you can’t get a personal consultation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping out of the PhD-Postdoc dogma might be scary. It feels like the years in high school, university, graduate school prepared us for one ultimate goal - to become a professor. However, it is not true. PhD can be a starting step to variety of careers. Did you know, that there is a job called molecular animator? Yes, you need a PhD for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was inspired by TED-talk of Emilie Wapnick, which  introduced me to the whole new concept -  multipotentialites, as people with many interests and creative pursuits. Instead of fixing on one “true calling” for the whole life they keep exploring new areas and combine their various, sometimes opposite interests. It is all about goal-passion-qualification triangle again and making the best out of it. Are you sure science is your only passion? If not, why not to combine your interests into something bigger? One of the examples is Mayim Chaya Bialik, who is famous for her role as Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler in Big Bang Theory. Mayim has a PhD in neuroscience (for real!) and successfully combines her career as scientist, writer and actress. Another inspiring case is Dr. Randy Olson, who was a professor in marine biology before moving to Hollywood and becoming a filmmaker. His movies go further than just “educational films”: he introduces public to evolution, global warming, ocean pollution. He combines deep scientific knowledge with passion for moviemaking to arouse interest to such complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the options are limitless and go far beyond classical academia-industry dilemma. Every year more and more PhDs are moving for a job outside academia, even if PhD training prepares us for one career only - professorship. How do you become a successful science communicator, entrepreneur, patent agent or policy maker after such a training? You don’t. All of these careers require a PhD, but PhD only  is not sufficient to be successful. Often additional training is required to become fit for one or another job. This realisation comes slowly and initiates a lot of discussion, so we might see some changes in the PhD training soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helmholtz Association works towards an implementation of career advice service as a part of PhD and PostDoc training. Career advice and alumni networks are already well established in some graduate schools and for some centers it is still a work in progress. Of course, a personal consultation would be the best solution, but finding a suitable candidate for the job might be a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all sounds very promising, but I feel it is impossible to make one training program which includes all the needs of every career path possible. Therefore individual development plans are important and it is a good idea to make one as early as you can. This can be done either with a help of career advisor or maybe using something such as myIDP software. Learn as much as you can about different jobs requirements and plan courses you take accordingly. It might be difficult to squeeze them into packed experimental plan for your thesis, but it is totally worth it in a long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, there is a life after PhD and it is far more diverse than I ever imagined. There are many options besides academia worth exploring and the road can take you anywhere! You just have to be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our modern understanding of all electric phenomena more or less starts with Maxwells equations from 1865 (Fig. 1 – 4). That there were no magnetic monopoles in fact was known earlier (1) and that electric charges are the sources of „force lines“ as well (2). The essentials of the induction law (3) were known and also Oersteds detection that an electric current creates a rotating magnetic field around it had been published, left part of (4). But why did Maxwell then find it necessary to introduce the electric displacement in the form of the second term in (4)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maxwell studied Faraday&amp;rsquo;s publications very carefully and he also recommended this to all physicists. - An old question was: „Why does a magnet attract a piece of soft iron in a certain distance according to Newton&amp;rsquo;s „actio = reactio“– law (5)? The well known experimental answer was: „The soft iron piece is transformed to become a magnet itself (6).“ Faraday now stated that the initial magnet impossibly could change properties of an object at a larger distance while ignoring all closer locations. And in fact if we put iron filings in between again all fluff individuals become small magnets arranging themselves along what then was still called force lines (7). The frenchman La Hire published this as early as in 1717. Faraday therefore started systematic experiments in order to try if the situation is analogous in electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A charged object polarizes an insulator at some distance (8). We call it „influence“, Faraday still named it „induction“. In order to study the role of space he therefore filled the gap between the two conductors of a spherical condenser with different insulating materials. The use of a „spherical“ arrangement eliminated disturbing border effects! All these „dielectrics“ altered the field in the gap in a well defined way(9). Therefore Faraday finally also tried what happens in vacuum – and really even in that case influence took place. Vacuum was electrically active too and obviously very much different from just „nothing“!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both magnets and dipoles arranged as in the upper part of (10) were known to exhibit longitudinal attraction and transverse repulsion. Faraday generalized this to yield also for force lines themselves. That force lines tend to contract can be directly observed as the attraction between two charged metal plates of an plane condenser. But what about transverse repulsion? A local concentration of charges on condenser-plates as shown to the left in (10) is known not to be stable. Charge distribution will rather change to become uniform as in the right figure. We use to interprete this as a consquence of charge repulsion on conducting surfaces (or even more sophisticated as a consequence of equipotentials). Faraday, however, regarded it as a prime consequence of force lines transverse repulsion – and found the proof for this interpretation in the outbulging field at borders where no charges explicitely do exist!&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maxwell read all this and finally realized that vacuum just should be regarded as a special kind of dielectrics. This means that materials due to their polarization always transform an electric field E into a „displacement field“ D = ε ε₀ E where the vacuum situation just is the particular case with ε = 1 (written in our modern nomenclature). A varying charge displacement in time therefore would behave just as any other electrical current. - This was the simple, bright and extremely successful idea!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1845 Faraday after many stressing efforts finally found the famous effect now bearing his name: The plane of linearly polarized light passing along the axis of a glass rod was rotated by a magnetic field originating from the electrical current through a coil around it. Maxwell considered what this does mean to magnetic force lines as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must now take into consideration that physics in the 19th century still was dominated completely by mechanics. William Thomson, the late Lord Kelvin e. g. stated: „I never satisfy myself until I can make a mechanical model of a thing. If I can make a mechanical model, I can understand it. As long as I cannot make a mechanical model all the way through I cannot understand it.“ It was in this context that even Ludwig Boltzmann constructed a perfect mechanical model to demonstrate Faraday&amp;rsquo;s electromagnetic induction. (It still exists in the university of Graz, the author has seen it working!) So it takes no wonder that also Maxwell started on this path in 1861-1862.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maxwell thus began to regard the magnetic field as a conglomerate of flexible rotating, narrow tubes representing force lines (11). A rotating experimentally observed phenomenon might be transmitted only by field features rotating in screw form by themselves! He imagined the field strength not to be represented primarily by angular velocity but rather by the peripherical linear velocity of these tubes. An increasing radius of the tubes therefore would directly stand for Faraday&amp;rsquo;s transverse repulsion of the lines. The best corresponding mathematical model for all this existed in hydrodynamics at the time – and Maxwell was familiar with it, last not least because simultaneously his colleague Georges Stokes was active in Cambridge. Maxwell consequently tried to „translate“ hydrodynamics into a new language in order to find a coherent mathematical description for all electro-magnetic phenomena. Density for instance was replaced by permeability so that finally the „curling magnetic energy“ became proportional to the square of the field strength, and also a plausible form of Coulomb&amp;rsquo;s experimentally verified law was achieved. One very serious problem, however, still existed with this model: Friction between uniformly rotating tubes in direct contact (11)! The well known solution with e. g. cogwheels in contact is the introduction of a compensating idle between neighbors. In the case of the magnetic tubes a large number of small balls - very small spheres with hardly any mass - could achieve a similar result (12). And all these idles around magnetic tubes would finally represent electric materia! - Note, that the idea of electrons, not to speak about their spin then still was very far away in future! – Constant rotation of the field-tubes with all balls essentially keeping their position in space represented a permanent magnet. The surprising fact with the idea, however, is that a local drift of this „ballgas“ perpendicularly to the tubes could induce (additional) rotation and thus represent Oersted&amp;rsquo;s experiment - the reverse procedure with peripherically accelerating tubes on the other hand Faraday&amp;rsquo;s induction of an electric current.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the almost unbelievable start! - None of all these for us strange and somewhat crude ideas appear in Maxwell&amp;rsquo;s later publications, especially the famous „Treatise“ from 1865 any more. The mathematical formalism there became consistent by itself. It finally covered much more future Physics than Maxwell himself maybe ever realized!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Helmholtz Juniors Annual Meeting 2017: HeJus Achievements and Plan</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/06/helmholtz-juniors-annual-meeting-2017-hejus-achievements-and-plan/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/06/helmholtz-juniors-annual-meeting-2017-hejus-achievements-and-plan/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2017/06/helmholtz-juniors-annual-meeting-2017-hejus-achievements-and-plan/images/csm_group_photo_2017_web_cbdc94603d.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Helmholtz Juniors Annual Meeting 2017: HeJus Achievements and Plan" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Same time of year, different Helmholtz center!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year, in February, the Helmholtz Juniors annual meeting took place in the beautiful Heidelberg, where the old city and the state-of-the-art cancer research facilities of the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;German Cancer Research Center&lt;/a&gt; (DKFZ) meet! Thirty-four representatives from all Helmholtz centers joined the 3-days meeting. We were fortunate that the spokespersons of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.phdnet.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Max Planck PhDnet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.leibniz-gemeinschaft.de/en/careers/the-next-generation-of-researchers/leibniz-phd-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p&gt;We had a very special tour in two of the most modern facilities for cancer research and treatment in Europe, the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.dkfz.de/en/medphysrad/workinggroups/ultrahighfieldmr/ultrahighfieldmr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;High-Field Whole Body MR (7 Tesla)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.klinikum.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php?id=112189&amp;amp;L=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Facility (HIT)&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to the arrangements of DKFZ HeJus, Danja and Elias, we also enjoyed our time in the old town of Heidelberg. Photo credits go to Elias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we achieved in 2016:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the meeting, &lt;a class="link" href="http://blogs.helmholtz.de/hejus/2017/02/meet-dagmara-and-elias-our-spokespersons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Dagmara&lt;/a&gt;, HeJus Spokesperson in 2015/16, pointed out that one of the HeJus&amp;rsquo; goal is to improve doctoral researchers&amp;rsquo; working conditions, yet the occasion to hear them out are limited to the survey and the NextGen conference. She said, &amp;ldquo;If we cannot hear from them, we cannot help them.&amp;rdquo; What we achieved and plan to achieve clearly reflect this goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HeJus are organized into 4 working groups: &lt;strong&gt;working conditions, survey, communications, and events&lt;/strong&gt;. On the first day, the speakers of each group reported on what their groups have accomplished in 2016. No surprise there, the achievements were astonishing! The events group reported on &lt;a class="link" href="https://blogs.helmholtz.de/hejus/2016/11/nextgen-2016-conference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;NextGen 2016&lt;/a&gt;, the first German-wide meeting of Helmholtz doctoral researchers. We also met members of the dedicated team of talented PhD students at GEOMAR, Kiel organizing NextGen. The group also gave us a glimpse of then preliminary &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz.de/en/about_us/press_and_media/events/nextgenhelmholtz_2017/program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;program&lt;/a&gt; of NextGen@Helmholtz 2017 in Kiel&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The working conditions group has worked with all HeJus for years on the most optimal &lt;strong&gt;working conditions statement&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;ldquo;65% TVöD E13 payment, 30 days of vacation, and a contract of minimum 3 years from the beginning with the doctoral project as the main job objective.&amp;rdquo; The working conditions group sent their statement to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz.de/ueber_uns/die_gemeinschaft/praesident/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Prof. Dr. Otmar D. Wiestler&lt;/a&gt;, the President of the Helmholtz Association. Prof. Wiestler kindly offered his time to respond to the statement (we will publish his response in a following blog post). All HeJus has sent the statement to their respective directors, and Lisa, the HeJu from GEOMAR, has shared with us a remarkable success story. GEOMAR Dokteam has met with the Director, &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.geomar.de/en/mitarbeiter/d/pherzig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Prof. Peter Herzig&lt;/a&gt;, concerning the statement, and within 1 month &lt;strong&gt;GEOMAR changed the status of 13 in-house and Max Planck stipend holders into 75% TVöD contracts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the largest research association in Germany, and believing that science is not isolated from the political and societal scenes, the working conditions group also prepared a &lt;strong&gt;questionnaire and sent it to the main German political parties&lt;/strong&gt; about their views on scientific research. The HeJus are awaiting for the answers which will be publicly available to guide the German voters prior to the elections in September, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efforts of HeJus spokespersons in 2015/16 Dagmara and Elias have secured the HeJus &lt;strong&gt;a budget of 50,000 EUR per year for 3 years&lt;/strong&gt;. The spokespersons are the contact point and external representation of the HeJus. They communicate regularly with other PhD networks and with the Helmholtz Association. We now have a direct contact at the headquarters to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz.de/en/jobs_talent/funding_programs/doctoral_students/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Dr. Johannes Freudenreich&lt;/a&gt;, who is known for his efforts promoting of young and early researchers with focus on postdocs, supervisors training and the newly formed international research schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey group shared with us the news that they have finished preparing &lt;strong&gt;the 2017 survey&lt;/strong&gt;. The available budged allowed them to run the survey on a secure platform. The survey covered many issues that are integral to the doctoral researchers such as: funding, supervision, graduate schools, working conditions, career plans, and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, all the updates, news, events and outreach have been brought to you by the communications group! We communicate the HeJus news to you through our various channels: the &lt;strong&gt;blog,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/helmholtz.juniors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/HelmholtzJrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/17993833/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; . We report on the various events that HeJus take part in. We also outreach for new HeJu members and introduce HeJus working groups to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we will achieve in 2017:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second day, we went on preparing our plan for 2017. The highlights are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/HelmholtzJrs/status/839768720243322880" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Network of Networks (N^2):&lt;/a&gt; The HeJus, Max Planck PhDnet and Leibniz PhD Network have been in close contact and exchange of experiences since the beginning of each of them. Now they formed N^2, a network for all doctoral researchers at all non-university research organizations in Germany. The first participation of N^2 was at the &lt;a class="link" href="https://blogs.helmholtz.de/hejus/2017/05/march-for-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;March For Science&lt;/a&gt;. N^2 plans joint events and call for interested doctoral researchers to participate in it. Stay tuned to know more about N^2 formation and activities here on the blog soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NextGen@Helmholtz at GEOMAR: NextGen is very special because it is an exclusive event of Helmholtz Association doctoral researchers. It has a unique nature as a multidisciplinary meeting. Its program includes a certificate-based science communication training. The alumni session is meant to provide the now students with various ideas of what is after-PhD. Through NextGen, we know about facilities at other Helmholtz Centers for perhaps future collaborations. Because of that all, the Hejus communicated to the graduate schools at all the centers to provide financial support and credit points for their doctoral researchers registering for NextGen.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Speakers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With their enthusiasm and expertise, we elected Giulia and Konstantin as the HeJus spokespersons for the year 2017. Giulia Caglio [&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.mdc-berlin.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine&lt;/a&gt; (MDC), Berlin] has been a member of the HeJus communications group. You certainly read her blog posts &lt;a class="link" href="http://blogs.helmholtz.de/hejus/about-the-authors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In the DokTeam, Giulia was proactive and had a sense of responsibility to improve the working conditions at her institute. She plans to pursue the same as a spokesperson of the HeJus. Konstantin Kuhne [&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf&lt;/a&gt; (HZDR), Dresden] was the HeJus treasurer for the past year. He gained an overview on the organization within the Helmholtz Association. We will hear from them here on the blog, and from the newly elected treasuress Lara Grünig from the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.hzg.de/index.php.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht Centre for Materials and Coastal Research&lt;/a&gt; (HZG).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what does that meeting mean for &amp;ldquo;non-HeJus&amp;rdquo;? We have a few recommendations in that regard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now officially in all HeJus documentations and communications we are all called &lt;strong&gt;“Doctoral Researchers”&lt;/strong&gt;! A term that precisely describes our day-to-day job at the largest research association in Germany, and empowers us to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctoral researchers are 50% of the working force at the Helmholtz Association and a significant fraction of the scientific output and publications is produced by doctoral researchers. The working conditions and survey groups &lt;strong&gt;need your input&lt;/strong&gt; from all the centers and to react upon it to improve the contracts and working conditions of the students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for a series of &lt;strong&gt;interviews and interesting research project from all the Helmholtz centers&lt;/strong&gt; here on the blog!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask the HeJu representatives of your center and your graduate school for our &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why to become a HeJu?&amp;rdquo; flyer&lt;/strong&gt;. Consider becoming the HeJu representative of your center in the next elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get involved!&lt;/strong&gt; If you missed NextGen 2017 registration, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/helmholtz.juniors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;like us&lt;/a&gt; and be ready for N^2 events and NextGen 2018!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;h6 id="enjoy-the-reading"&gt;Enjoy the reading!
&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever tried to explain your PhD project to your Grandma? Than you know already delivering complex ideas could be a real hassle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 30th of March nine young scientists showed us how it’s done during the preliminary FameLab competition at the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research (HZI) (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;https://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/en/&lt;/a&gt;). The participants gave us a glimpse into a variety of projects, from autoimmunity to aviation, convincing the audience that their scientific projects are the most exciting of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven different institutions were represented on the science communication competition. Among them were HZI, Twincore, Technische Universität Braunschweig, the Medical School Hannover, the Leibniz Universität Hannover, the Max-Planck-Institut für Eisenforschung and Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event started with warm welcome words of Prof. Dirk Heinz, the scientific director of HZI. Prof. Heinz introduced the members of the jury and participants, and in his speech he underlined the importance of science communication on every step of a research career. However, I believe, the importance of science communication is far beyond just one’s scientific career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research gets more and more complex and it is important to deliver it to public in an engaging, but also clear and accurate way. And that’s what FameLab is all about! The three whales for winning the competition are content, clarity and charisma. The rules are simple: participants have to explain their projects in less than a three minutes, being within one square meter space on stage just with the use of  objects they can carry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year&amp;rsquo;s jury consisted of four members: Johannes Kaufmann (editor of Braunschweigischer Zeitung), Prof. Dr. Michael Steinert (TU Braunschweig, Infection Biology), Claudia Gorille (Journalist) and Axel Richter (Braunschweigische Stiftung). The jury were to choose the best presentation based on best didactics, scientific context, body language and the most convincing line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competition was extremely tough. Every short presentation carried the audience into excitement and challenges of the field. Even the most experienced critics could not predict the winner. The competition kept the tension on till the very end. I have to say, it was a real nailbiter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, the first prize was snatched by Panagiota Mamareli from the TWINCORE for her presentation on “The role of intracellular fatty acid metabolism on intestinal immune responses”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second prize went to Aniruddha Dutta from the Max-Planck-Institut für Eisenforschung. He showed a complex matter of steel improvement using just an ordinary Oreo cookie! The audience also got to make  their own champion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicola Ganter, from the Technische Universität Braunschweig won the audience prize. The winners of this round of FameLab will get a money price together with a media training from the best coaches in science communication. Furthermore they will take part in the German final in Bielefeld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After every presentation, the jury gave feedback to the participants to help them improve their presentation. I believe, that those advises would be useful not only to the participants, but also to every presenter. So, here is what we learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passion and confidence are the key for a successful presentation: only an inspired scientist can get a listener excited about his/her project and gain the attention. If you don’t believe yourself, that your project is the coolest one, how are you going to convince the audience?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a healthy balance between complex ideas and didactic: think of a most clear and comprehensive metaphors. Just, don’t go too far! Every thing you tell to the audience has to be correct!  For example, it might seem as a good idea to compare a reproducible experiment with a unicorn, but don’t go over the rainbow!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your story telling the scientific context and its future perspective is important. Tell your audience what motivated you to do your project and how it can bring us to a brighter future. Take-home message is key!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use your voice. Speak loudly and confidently; don’t be afraid to use the whole range of your voice and change the tempo. Go fast, slow down, pause to make concepts sink in. Even the most exciting lines of your talk will go unnoticed if you keep robotic tone through the whole talk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use your body. Move towards your audience when you want to highlight your point and go back in between. Body language is engaging: don’t stand still.  People are not used to listen to a talking monument and most probably won’t take it seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grab their attention from the beginning: use jokes to make them laugh or a statistics to scare them. For example, did you know that doctoral researchers have two times higher chance to get crazy than the general population? True story!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Involve the audience into your presentation. Ask them questions and make them choose between different solutions. Surprise them and keep them awake. More: react to the conditions! Is it hot in the auditorium? How can your invention impact this problem?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate not only the idea, but the scientific process as well. A broad audience doesn’t necessary know how the experiments go or how failure and “Eureka!” moments go hand in hand in research. Give the audience some insights: let them follow the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a law in  theater: “One must not put a loaded rifle on the stage if no one is thinking of firing it”. The same rule applies here. Use all the props you brought with you on stage, or don’t bring them at all. If you come to the stage wearing mouse ears and a tail, everyone will be waiting for an of what they are for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no science without science communication: we all have to communicate our ideas, independent of the field of study. Science communications is not only communication of science to the public, but it is also communication with fellow scientists and future collaborators, experts in our field or not. So I believe, that those advices I shared with you would be helpful to your everyday life as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year FameLab brings together the best science communicators, we can get inspired and learn from. If you would like to know more about successful FameLab presentations, just check out official &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/famelab" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

And, of course, join the competition next year, if you’re up to it!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>NextGen 2016: More than a Conference!</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2016/11/nextgen-2016-more-than-a-conference/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2016/11/nextgen-2016-more-than-a-conference/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today, we have a special guest post by &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Danja_Sarink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Danja Sarink&lt;/a&gt;, PhD Candidate at the Division of Cancer Epidemiology, The German Cancer Research Center (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;DKFZ&lt;/a&gt;). Danja is also the spokesperson of the Survey Group of the HeJus. Now I leave you with a brilliant inside look at NextGen 2016!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 28-30 September Helmholtz Juniors hosted the very first NextGen@Helmholtz conference. Nearly &lt;strong&gt;120 doctoral researchers&lt;/strong&gt; from all Helmholtz centers joined us for action-packed: three days of networking, presenting and learning, at &lt;strong&gt;the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research&lt;/a&gt; in Braunschweig&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an impression of the conference have a look!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did we do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start the conference and to introduce all 18 Helmholtz Centers participants &lt;strong&gt;presented their institute in one minute&lt;/strong&gt;. We got a fantastic overview of the huge diversity of research going on in the Helmholtz Association – and the creativity of PhD students! Who knew that umbrellas make excellent jellyfish? And that maybe, next time, we should take into account when Oktoberfest happens!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main focus points of NextGen was &lt;strong&gt;multidisciplinary&lt;/strong&gt; and we challenged participants to explain their work to doctoral researchers from different fields; 83 participants presented their research in three poster sessions. There was naturally a lot of discussion between researchers from similar fields, but the amount of crosstalk – physicists explaining their work to sociologists, engineers asking about the work of geologists, and so on – was amazing to see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisa Bittner (Influence of pH on the toxicity of pharmaceuticals in zebrafish embryos, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=33573" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;UFZ&lt;/a&gt;), Mia Rudolph (Serial Protein Crystallography in Living Cells, &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.desy.de/index_eng.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;DESY&lt;/a&gt;) and Uli Einhaus (ROPPERI-A TPC readout with Timepix and pads, DESY) did an especially great job explaining their work, and received the &lt;strong&gt;poster awards&lt;/strong&gt;. Congratulations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six truly brave doctoral researchers participated in the &lt;strong&gt;NextGen Science Slam&lt;/strong&gt;, and we saw some really innovative takes on science – appealing to participants’ empathy, sense of humor and sense of rhythm. We have to give a honorable mention the impressive rap from UFZ’s very own McBiogas (Fabian Bonk), but the audience awarded the best science slam to Daniel Meza Arredondo from HZB, who talked about mom, Pesos and a chocolate vending machine on Mexikoplatz in Berlin, which was an excellent analogy for his work on solar cells. Congratulations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, at this point, everyone at NextGen knew all about the Helmholtz Association and how to present their doctoral work – &lt;strong&gt;but what comes after&lt;/strong&gt;? The classical path of doctorate-postdoc-professor is of course not nearly the only option for a doctoral researcher and the alumni session offered the opportunity for participants to talk to Helmholtz alumni about their career paths. The 12 alumni who joined were all at different stages in their careers – anywhere between postdoc and retired – and some had taken surprising career paths to get to their current jobs in various sectors, ranging from academia to science communication, to technology and product management in industry, to entrepreneurship and politics. The round tables were swamped and alumni spoke to participants to the absolute end of the session and, for those who could stay, even after the session ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alumni session was followed (after an amazing lunch) by a multidisciplinary workshop, where carefully randomized teams of doctoral researchers from all Helmholtz centers were put on the spot: &lt;strong&gt;how could humanity travel to and survive on Mars?&lt;/strong&gt; Every team was required to include all their members fields in their mission plan, but we kept other parameters for this task deliberately vague (will earth still be there to go back to? Will space travel exist?). Seven teams presented very varied takes and some very convincing reasoning on this challenge – a focus on the journey to Mars versus what to do on Mars, keeping the space craft operational versus using it for resources, living above ground versus living below, relying on trade versus Mars’ own resources. One of the most important tools for success is of course using the skills of everyone involved, and proposals were judged as such by Dr. Rebecca Ludwig, project manager with the cross-disciplinary &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.enlight-ten.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;ENLIGHT-TEN&lt;/a&gt; program. For missions this big, there can only be one winning proposal – Congratulations to the ingenious crew of M.Pathfinder!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, NextGen hosted an &lt;strong&gt;expert panel on the topic of “publish or perish”&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz.de/ueber_uns/die_gemeinschaft/praesident/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Prof. Wiestler&lt;/a&gt; (President of the Helmholtz Association), &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.jacobs-university.de/directory/alerchl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Prof. Alexander Lerchl&lt;/a&gt; (Jacobs University Bremen), &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz-hzi.de/en/research/research_topics/anti_infectives/chemical_biology/mark_broenstrup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Prof. Mark Brönstrup&lt;/a&gt; (HZI Braunschweig), and &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.icm.tu-bs.de/%7Ebeick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Prof. Bettina Eick&lt;/a&gt; (TU Braunschweig). It was a great experience to listen to professionals talking about the broad topic, its influence on their fields of research, and how it relates to doctoral researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did we do well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two thirds of the participants completed our &lt;strong&gt;exit-survey&lt;/strong&gt;, and results were overwhelmingly positive! Nearly all participants rated NextGen@Helmholtz as very good (62%) or good (34%), and a stunning 88% would recommend it to others. The science slam (68% very good; 21% good) and alumni sessions (49% very good; 35% good) were rated as highlights of the program. Opinions on the poster session, multidisciplinary workshop, and expert panel were a bit more divided – though they were still rated as good or very good by at least half of the participants. The time available for and facilitation of networking (social activities, workshops, etc) during the conference were also well received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2016/11/nextgen-2016-more-than-a-conference/images/Picture1-2-1000x309.png"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are always things that could have gone better, and that we will of course aim to improve! The two points participants liked least were the venue for the poster session (5% very poor; 19% poor) and the time available for the multidisciplinary workshops (7% very poor; 24% poor[1]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A big “thank you!” to…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to extend a big “Thank you!” to the Helmholtz Association for making it possible for us to organize NextGen@Helmholtz, the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (HZI) in Braunschweig for hosting us, and to all speakers and participants for making it a success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next for NextGen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope NextGen@Helmholtz will continue to provide an informal and low pressure environment for doctoral researchers to talk and gain ideas about their science and their PhD (and beyond), and to try new approaches to presenting their work, both regarding new formats and people from completely unrelated fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye out for NextGen@Helmholtz 2017 at the Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.geomar.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;GEOMAR&lt;/a&gt;) in Kiel!&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to web page). Three days in Braunschweig for a multidisciplinary meeting that will involve 127 Doctoral Researchers and guests. Prof. Wiesler, President of the Helmholtz association, who believes on the importance of promoting the connection between Helmholtz institutes, will join for the expert panel talks, targeting the “Publish or Perish” philosophy in academia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3 days will give the researcher the possibility to network and learn about other institutes and peers research, present their work, as well as meet with Alumni to discuss future opportunities after the PhD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the slogan says, this is a conference organised by PhDs for PhDs and it has as main focus bringing together experts in different disciplines to foster ideas and discussions outside their field. The world is moving to a multidisciplinary approach everyday more, and the Helmholtz institutes offer a variety of expertise that could collaborate together. In this direction goes the challenge of the multidisciplinary workshop that will see different teams compete to plan the best way to colonize Mars - future is never too far! Additionally, science slam will offer an opportunity to practice communication skills, also in an unconventional way - dancing, acting, talking, everything is welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, as Helmholtz Juniors, are excited for this great opportunity and grateful for the immense work the event group put to make these 3 days unforgettable for all the participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you will like it and it will become the event the doctoral research will look forward in all the Helmholtz centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you there!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Helmholtz Juniors Midterm Meeting 2016: PhD contracts and British doctoral system were among the highlights</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2016/07/helmholtz-juniors-midterm-meeting-2016-phd-contracts-and-british-doctoral-system-were-among-the-highlights/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2016/07/helmholtz-juniors-midterm-meeting-2016-phd-contracts-and-british-doctoral-system-were-among-the-highlights/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2016/07/helmholtz-juniors-midterm-meeting-2016-phd-contracts-and-british-doctoral-system-were-among-the-highlights/images/LOGO_Blue2.png" alt="Featured image of post Helmholtz Juniors Midterm Meeting 2016: PhD contracts and British doctoral system were among the highlights" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 13, the Helmholtz Juniors (you may know as HeJus) conducted their meeting in Berlin, which lasted for two days. More than 30 Juniors came from Helmholtz Centers all over Germany to join the Midterm Meeting taking place at the Helmholtz Association’s Headquarters (HGF) in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For weeks before the meeting, the Juniors were preparing the agenda and gathering information across all centers and the HeJus working groups on the working conditions of PhD students and also the major problems that the students at each center are facing. The agenda of the Midterm Meeting included discussions on the PhD contract model that HeJus Working Conditions group has been working on, and a session by &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/oes/postgraduate/research_students/km1g14.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Kyle Mayers&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Southampton on the British doctoral system. The agenda also included the ongoing preparations for the soon coming Helmholtz PhD conference “&lt;a class="link" href="https://indico.scc.kit.edu/indico/event/229/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;NextGen@Helmholtz&lt;/a&gt;” taking place this September at HZI in Braunschweig. The HeJus met up with the new members joining this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and the 2016 meeting is casting its shadow (or more appropriate: its light). So time has come for recapitulating what we did during this year and also for some of us – for example me – it is time to hand over our ideas, visions and tasks to the ones that are joining the Helmholtz Juniors for 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this process of recapitulating is not meant to be exclusively for ourselves, the Helmholtz Juniors newsletter 2015 was written to give others the opportunity to see and read what we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working on the newsletter, together with my fellow Communication Group mates I realized that it is quite a lot that has been achieved during the year and that some of these achievements may be the foundation for interesting developments in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to confess that I did not expect this conclusion. The work on my tasks in the Communication group always seemed to suffer from the PhD workload and resulting small amounts of time that I could invest in doing and organizing the tasks we agreed upon. But as I said before, sitting in my gloomy office and writing this lines (the office is not so gloomy actually) I have the feeling that we did a good job and I want to use this post as an opportunity to thank my fellow group mates and all the people that were working in the other Helmholtz Juniors groups for doing a great job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you doubt my words, have a look into our newsletter :)&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe it involves moving to a new city or even a new country, maybe it means getting in touch with the German bureaucracy (there is a reason for its negative reputation) for the first time and ultimately it for sure means being confronted with rights and duties of a supervised PhD candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to provide advice and a helping hand when facing any of these issues – or others that I didn’t mention here – we, the Helmholtz Juniors, gathered lots and lots of information and put them into our handbook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHD IN THE HELMHOLTZ ASSOCIATION A HANDBOOK FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE PHD CANDIDATES IN THE HELMHOLTZ ASSOCIATION.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="15_Juniors_Handbook_150513.pdf" &gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/08/phd-in-the-helmholtz-association-a-handbook-for-phds/images/2015-08-25_144201-706x1000.png"

&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name may be long but the information provided inside is to the point and well readable (my opinion at least) using short paragraphs and often a question-and-answer design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some may think “Hey wait, we have something similar at our center already!” That’s true. In a short survey we saw that 11 out of 15 Helmholtz Centers, whose PhD representative groups took part in the survey, already have some information material for new PhDs or foreign colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless we think that our handbook is an additional source of information worth having a look at. It was written by PhD students for PhD students and greatly benefits from the experiences that the writers made during their time at their centers. And while the PhD info material in some centers is a bit short on content, our handbook covers a great many of aspects one may be interested in regardless if he or she is new or advanced PhD candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So last words here from me: Give it a try! Read the handbook and if you like what you see: Recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Helmholtz Juniors Mid-Term Meeting 2015 in Berlin</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/07/helmholtz-juniors-mid-term-meeting-2015-in-berlin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/07/helmholtz-juniors-mid-term-meeting-2015-in-berlin/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/07/helmholtz-juniors-mid-term-meeting-2015-in-berlin/images/DSCF4547_med2.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Helmholtz Juniors Mid-Term Meeting 2015 in Berlin" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the 20th and 21st of July, the Helmholtz Juniors Mid-Term Meeting took place at the Helmholtz Association&amp;rsquo;s Head Office (HGF) in Berlin. It was the second Mid-Term Meeting ever and proved to be a great opportunity to meet each other again, to discuss the latest progress and problems, and to improve the cooperation of the Helmholtz Juniors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the first day of the meeting, we were welcomed by Caroline Krüger from the Helmholtz head office. The working phase was opened up with presentations from all Helmholtz Juniors working groups on the activities of the last half year and on future plans for the upcoming half year. Afterwards two guests from the Helmholtz Head Office gave a parallel session on two of the main topics we deal with. Elsbeth Lesner was guest of a discussion round on working conditions, PhD contracts and stipends. Jennifer Schevardo gave a firm presentation on different networks within the Helmholtz Community with a focus on the new “Helmholtz &amp;amp; Friends” Alumni network. “Helmholtz &amp;amp; Friends” aims to strengthen the Helmholtz-Feeling within the Association and initiates the build-up of a new network of peers that provide exchange of knowledge basically concentrating on social skills and leadership (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/helmholtz_friends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Helmholtz &amp;amp; Friends&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch – a delicious one by the way – our next guest was Sabine Helling-Moegen, the administrative head of the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE). She gave a brief overview of the history of the German “Großforschungseinrichtungen” and of the the Helmholtz Association and described the process from narrow research topics towards nowadays program oriented research and the program oriented funding (“Programmorientierte Förderung”, POF). The interesting talk and the following discussion gave us the opportunity to gain a better understanding of mechanisms and politics in science and education in general and in the Helmholtz Association, in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last part of the first day was dedicated to a discussion on an overall strategy of the Helmholtz Juniors and on tasks for upcoming half year and their priority:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focus for the working conditions group: reduce number of in-house stipends and increase number of vacation days to 28 or 30&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improve the motivation of all PhD students to be part in the local PhD representative initiatives and in the Helmholtz Juniors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;enhance visibility of the Helmholtz Juniors: Only if we are visible, we can change something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strengthen the connection to the HGF head office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strengthen our network to other groups which work for improving working conditions in science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improve continuity after handover to new Helmholtz Juniors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first day was concluded with dinner in a nice restaurant in Berlin‘s center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second day of our Mid-term meeting was dedicated towards group work. The working conditions group recapitulated their meeting with Elsbeth Lesner from the previous day. The Event group started planning a Helmholtz PhD day which should take place in 2016. Both, the Survey and the Communications working groups attended an Q&amp;amp;A session with Jan-Martin Wiarda, Bianca Berlin and Janine Tychsen from the Helmholtz Communications and Media Relations Office. The three of them were faced with several questions on internal and external communication issues. Besides receiving useful answers, possible contacts for our communication-related issues, and insight into the current projects of their group, we were encouraged to raise a critical voice inside and outside of the Helmholtz Association whenever necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a wrap-up and a basket of tasks for the upcoming months, we finished our Mid-term meeting in the early afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point we, the Helmholtz Juniors, want to thank all our guests, the Helmholtz Association&amp;rsquo;s Head Office and the events working group. The meeting was a great success and will motivate us and enhance our future work.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>GÉANT - faster than light (almost) European research network</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/07/g%C3%A9ant-faster-than-light-almost-european-research-network/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/07/g%C3%A9ant-faster-than-light-almost-european-research-network/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/07/g%C3%A9ant-faster-than-light-almost-european-research-network/images/GEANT_logo_2015.jpg" alt="Featured image of post GÉANT - faster than light (almost) European research network" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, while being stuck in a traffic jam on a Friday afternoon, I listened to a radio report on the Deutschlandfunk. It was about GÉANT, the namely gigantic backbone of our European science computer network and in one way or another the reason for the fact that one often finds itself staring at turtle-speed data download bars at home that turn to olympic-like sprinters at the institute. (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/netz-uebertraegt-nur-daten.684.de.html?dram:article_id=312297&amp;amp;dram:audio_id=347422&amp;amp;dram:play=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;You can listen to the German report / interview following this link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s behind that big name that provides science with high-speed internet? First a short detour on history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet that has a multitude of uses nowadays was originally designed to provide better ways for communication and data exchange for two groups of players. The military and the scientific community. This initial phase was dated in the 60’s and 70’s and the place of happening was … the United States of America, of course [1]. It was in the beginning 80s that Europe and later Germany made their leaps in terms of scientific computer networking with the “Deutsches Forschungsnetz” being founded, which is until now connecting German university and research facilities and the rest of the world. On the European level the backbone was developed consecutively, each new project with a fancier name than the previous one (IXI, EMPB, TEN-155 just to name some examples, for more see [2]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was then in 2001 that the new European backbone, funded by the European Union, with the name of GÉANT started working. While having assigned the name GÉANT2 for some years, it returned to its original name GÉANT in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today GÉANT connects the National Research and Education Networks (NREN) of about 40 European countries with each other [3] and also with the rest of the world (figure below). It provides a maximum network bandwidth of 500Gbps (gigabits per second) in the core network and has the capacity to be upgraded to 8 Tbps (terabits per second) [4]. With these characteristics, GÉANT is currently the world’s most advanced research and education network [5].&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we need such a data-transferring capacity one may ask?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As research is becoming more and more of a collaborative work, communication of participants across any distance becomes more and more important as well. This communication is not only about sharing ideas but also about sharing and storing data. In some cases huge amounts of data as for example CERN, one of GÉANT’s partners, produces one petabyte of data (= 1000 terabytes) every day [7]. The infrastructure that enables this communication is called e-infrastructure. Besides networks, such e-infrastructure also includes data storage and processing functionality. GÉANT was designed to be the “flagship” of the European e-infrastructure and looking at some of the numbers written earlier it seems to do a good job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For myself I am looking forward hearing more from GÉANTs future development. Not necessarily while being stuck in a traffic jam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone who wants to know more about the project. The &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.geant.net/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;internet page&lt;/a&gt; contains a lot of nice (but sometimes outdated) information. In the meanwhile the GÉANT staff is working on a new web presence that can be found &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.geant.org/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p&gt;Last week, we reported about the changes in the way PhD students are to be treated in the Helmholtz Association. As could be read in the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.zeit.de/2015/13/max-planck-institut-doktorand-forschung" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;German news&lt;/a&gt; in March and April 2015, the Max Planck Society has meanwhile not been inactive: On March 23rd, the Max Planck Society published a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.mpg.de/9067759/enhanced-funding-junior-scientists-max-planck-society" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; presenting a plan to spend “50 million Euro for junior scientists”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, one can split the attempts to improve the situation of PhD students and postdocs into two parts: give every doctoral student and every PostDoc a contract and improve the supervision by providing at least a second Professor as supervisor and mentor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;== The two-class society of stipend holders and contract holders==&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more than 3400 stipend funded PhD students, the Max Planck Society is one of the biggest providers of PhD positions in Germany. Many PhD students come from abroad, and until now most of them have been provided with a stipend instead of a regular contract. But what is the problem with stipends? Although stipends offer benefits like more independence, they have some major disadvantages like lack of social securities, health and unemployment insurance, parental leave and pension, to name just a few. A more detailed description of the pros and cons of stipends can be found here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To eliminate this funding-based difference between PhD students, the Max Planck Society will spend 50 million Euro per year to provide contracts instead of stipends to all of their doctoral students and postdocs. Furthermore, these contracts are granted for three years with an opportunity to extend for another year, so that students can focus on their work instead of worrying about follow-up funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the drawbacks of conventional staff contracts, however, is that PhD students also have to work on projects not related to their PhD topic (as it is e. g. still usual in engineering), such as giving lectures, supervising practical courses or performing routine tasks for their institute. Similar to the independence of these tasks granted by a stipend and unlike conventional contracts, these new PhD contracts are designed to ensure that you are not working on unrelated topics, but only on your own project. However, some drawbacks remain: there are exceptions to the no-stipend rule for guests working “on a particular project and for a limited time” who can still be funded by stipends without social security. These new guidelines do not affect any existing contracts or stipends and it is still unclear what the actual contracts encompass with regards to salary and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;== Supervision ==&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second big issue addressed is the situation of supervision of doctoral students and their perspectives after finishing the PhD. The Max Planck Society is aware of the situation that less than 10 % of PhDs stay in science. Therefore more than 90 % of the PhD students would benefit from courses and programs preparing them for jobs in industry or economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another more challenging approach for improving this situation is setting up contracts between the candidate, the supervising professor and another third person at a university. In the case of conflict between candidate and supervisor the third person mediates between the supervisor and the PhD student. The President of the Max Planck Society, Martin Statmann, hopes that each Professor supervising a student recognises and clearly communicates if a doctoral student is well suited for a career in research or if other branches seem to be more promising for the student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, this new development at the Max Planck Society is a big step in the right direction with still some minor flaws.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Helmholtz Association—improved conditions for PhD students</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/05/helmholtz-associationimproved-conditions-for-phd-students/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/05/helmholtz-associationimproved-conditions-for-phd-students/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/05/helmholtz-associationimproved-conditions-for-phd-students/images/phd-guidelines1.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Helmholtz Association—improved conditions for PhD students" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Juliane Hafermann, Julian Gethmann and Stephan Körner (Helmholtz Juniors Survey Group)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are moving in the scientific world: the working conditions of PhD students in two large German scientific societies, the Helmholtz Association and the Max Planck Society, will be improved dramatically. This week we will present recent developments at the Helmholtz Association. Stay tuned for more insights into the changes at the Max Planck society next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Helmholtz Association recently made huge progress in the way they treat PhD students. A working group chaired by Prof. Dirk Heinz and coordinated by Nina Löchte (who is responsible for the promotion of young and early-stage researchers and international networking) has prepared &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/fileadmin/user_upload/06_jobs_talente/Doktoranden/epaper-PhD-Guidelines/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;guidelines for the completion of PhD projects&lt;/a&gt; within the Helmholtz Association. The &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/en/working_at_helmholtz/doctoral_students/helmholtz_juniors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Helmholtz Juniors&lt;/a&gt;, PhD representatives from every Helmholtz Centre in Germany, were also heard and involved in the process of writing these guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Germany’s largest scientific research organisation, the Helmholtz Association comprises 18 research centres working in six different fields: Energy, Earth and Environment, Health, Aeronautics, Space and Transport as well as Key Technologies plus Matter. A total of 36,000 staff work there, approximately 6,500 of them PhD students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These PhD students make a significant contribution to the research and the successes of the Helmholtz Association. Thus, the Helmholtz Association is interested in promoting and supporting them and their career with a talent management concept. 34 Research Schools and Graduate Schools have already been set up by the Helmholtz Association, offering a structured education and training for doctoral students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up the Graduate and Research Schools had been a first important step. Since then, further measures have been taken to improve the situation of PhD students within the Helmholtz Association. The Helmholtz PhD guidelines are an agreement on minimum standards that have to be met for the completion of PhD projects under optimal conditions. They strive to provide a wide range of training and development opportunities in order to prepare PhD students for their future careers in academia or industry as well as outside of research positions. Their aim is to create a common quality to the PhD training at all Helmholtz Centres, facilitate quality assurance and give guidance to both PhD students and their supervisors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidelines make several recommendations for best practice during PhD training with the aim to turn these best practice examples into the minimal standards of PhD training within the Helmholtz Association. They endorse Research Schools and Graduate Schools, which provide a structured training and educational programme according to the needs of the individual PhD student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 9 out of the 18 Helmholtz centres award stipends, and according to the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.heju-survey.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;latest Helmholtz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/en/jobs_talents/doctoral_students/helmholtz_juniors/working_groups_activities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Juniors Survey&lt;/a&gt;, 22 % of the survey participants are funded by a stipend. While stipends allow for more independence than conventional contracts do, they do not include health and pension insurance or other social securities. A more detailed comparison between stipends and contracts as well as all their benefits and drawbacks was published by the Helmholtz Juniors Working Conditions Group. The text is available in both German and English and can be found here:  &lt;a class="link" href="http://blogs.helmholtz.de/hejus/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2015/05/20150429_Stipends_AHK.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Detailed information on stipends&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to further improve the working conditions and the social security of PhD students in particular, the guidelines are an important step in the right direction as they advocate paid contracted positions including social security contributions. Furthermore, the guidelines state that the contract period should equal the expected duration of the PhD, with an optional extension period and additional funding until the dissertation is submitted in case the project cannot be completed within the allotted time frame. However, stipends as such are not ruled out, and awarding them as a source of funding for PhD students remains a possibility, leaving an obvious loophole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidelines promote a system where the doctoral students do not solely depend on the goodwill of their supervisor. Instead, a committee of at least three scientists (one of them the primary supervisor) is to be informed about and consulted on the progress of the PhD project. This committee may furthermore give advice on career options and strategic questions during the PhD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PhD students are to be seen as “junior researchers undergoing preparation for their future careers through the process of completing a PhD”. The guidelines thus endorse support for career development, such as career advice and mentoring programmes for PhD students as well as career planning support after completion of the PhD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formation of student bodies – such as PhD representatives at the individual centres or the Helmholtz Juniors as an association-wide PhD student body – is encouraged. That way, PhD students can get involved in future decisions affecting them and the support they receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guidelines are certainly a great basis for the completion of PhD projects within the Helmholtz Association. However, there is one big drawback. So far, the guidelines are only best practice examples and recommendations. Every Helmholtz centre is technically free to choose which ones to implement and which ones to ignore. Furthermore, the situation of postdocs has not been addressed so far, which is another potential issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the Helmholtz centres have already set up conditions according to in accordance with parts of the guidelines, while still falling a short in other parts. In general, however, most PhD students enjoy good working conditions in the Helmholtz Association. The establishment of the PhD guidelines show that the necessity for changes has been recognised and that there is a willingness to improve the situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>SOPRAN annual meeting 2015</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/04/sopran-annual-meeting-2015/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/04/sopran-annual-meeting-2015/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/04/sopran-annual-meeting-2015/images/SOPRAN_logo_circle.jpg" alt="Featured image of post SOPRAN annual meeting 2015" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we all know Helmholtz Association is the Germany’s biggest scientific association and it encapsulates many research fields. One such major research field is Marine science. Recently, lot of focus has been put on marine research to address some of the major threats to the world’s ocean. Studies suggest ocean is greatly influenced by the anthropogenic activities, such as CO2 emissions. Changes in physics and chemistry of the ocean can have negative impact on the global climate and human society as well. Therefore, it is important that we start thinking about conserving our oceans (it’s high time now). Research institutes like GEOMAR, AWI etc. under Helmholtz umbrella are already addressing many of the scientific questions related to the change in the global ocean. There are many projects funded by German agencies and international agencies that are investigating impact of global climate change on the oceans and it’s feedback to the atmosphere. Once such project is SOPRAN, many research centers/universities like GEOMAR, AWI, Hamburg University etc. are part of SOPRAN project. This blog is on the SOPRAN annual meeting, which took place last month to highlight some of the key researches going on in SOPRAN and also the journey of SOPRAN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   SOPRAN is a joint project funded by BMBF (&lt;em&gt;Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung&lt;/em&gt; ) as well as SOLAS which is an international project. SOPRAN focuses on research related to atmosphere-ocean interactions, covering key aspects such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How changes in the atmospheric composition affects ocean ecosystem dynamics e.g. Global warming, Ocean acidification&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How climate related changes in the surface ocean processes (upwelling, mixing, photoacclimation etc.) affects oceanic emissions to the atmosphere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantifying rate of mass and energy fluxes exchanged between ocean and atmosphere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s SOPRAN annual meeting took place at Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz. Meeting started on 17/03/2015 at 14.00, Dr. Jonanthan Williams who is the head of research unit “Organic reactive species” in the Atmospheric chemistry department welcomed us and gave us the overview of the institute. We started with sharing some light moments over coffee and general introduction. Meeting officially kicked off with an introductory speech by Dr. Hermann Bange who is a senior scientist at GEOMAR, Kiel and also the scientific coordinator of SOPRAN. As he went on with his speech, we learnt about the progress of research works under SOPRAN umbrella and I have no hesitation to say it loud that senior and junior scientist involved in these research works have done a remarkable job. They came up with amazing findings/results and some of them are already published. Dr. Bange informed us that SOPRAN project in totality is a great success. However, we had mixed feelings because we knew that SOPRAN is coming to the end next year in January but at the same time we all showed commitment to take the legacy of SOPRAN forward. After the introductory speech, it was time for the overview talks. We learnt about the developments and scientific work, which are in progress under different research “themes” in SOPRAN by the respective PIs (principle investigators). After the overview talks we again went for a coffee session which was dominated by the exchange of scientific ideas between the peers. In the evening we had a poster session (of course with the coffee and cookies). Some of the posters out there blew me away, the work was mind-boggling. I enjoyed reading all of them but some of the research that fascinated were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Halocarbon emissions from the Baltic sea and how they alters atmospheric   composition“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Role of bacteria in degrading halocarbons in the oceans“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Emission of sea salt aerosols from the oceans and their impact on atmospheric radiation“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Understanding influence of winds on accumulation of the organic matter on the sea surface by Aeolotron experiment”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Understanding the effect of ocean acidification on the dynamics of the pelagic ecosystem from the diverse mesocosm experiments”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Modeling effect of mineral dust on the cloud chemistry in the Cape Verde region”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“ Inferring coastal upwelling velocities from the helium isotopes in the Peruvian upwelling region”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The showstopper for the evening came in form of lovely dinner at a restaurant in the city center. The vintage champagne in the restaurant greeted us and we all raised a toast for the success of SOPRAN. Next day we started the meeting with the “highlight” talks by the young scientists. Talks were amazing, addressing different scientific questions and approaches. I also gave a talk on my current research work, which is in the direction of addressing the question: “Effect of CO2 changes on the phytoplankton dynamics”. It was pleasing to see people were interested in my talk and afterwards gave me some useful inputs. That’s something I love about giving talks, you get some really valuable feedbacks. After the “highlight” talks, we discussed about the future of SOPRAN, some administrative stuff and also about the synthesis paper will be released sometime later in this year. Synthesis paper will summarize all the scientific accomplishments of the SOPRAN. The official end of the “SOPRAN annual meeting 2015“ was marked by the nice afternoon lunch and beverages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up, I thoroughly enjoyed the meeting and it was great learning and networking experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The “Helmholtz community feeling”</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/02/the-helmholtz-community-feeling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/02/the-helmholtz-community-feeling/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/02/the-helmholtz-community-feeling/images/Hermann_von_Helmholtz_01-e1424100244809.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The “Helmholtz community feeling”" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2015/02/the-helmholtz-community-feeling/images/Hermann_von_Helmholtz_01-209x300.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;On the sidelines of the Helmholtz Juniors Annual Meeting in January, an interesting idea came up: our work would be much easier if there was a strong sense of community – in other words, if we “felt more Helmholtz”. As the well-known blue-white Helmholtz logo can be found on the websites (just have a look at the top of this page), letter paper, business cards, etc. of each Centre, I wondered what this name actually represents and started looking for clues&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patron of the Helmholtz Association is &lt;strong&gt;Hermann von Helmholtz&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the leading natural scientists of the 19th century. He was interested in a wide range of scientific research and technological practice covering the fields of physics, medicine, mathematics and chemistry as well as psychology, philosophy and music. He was one of the last all-round academics not specialized in only one field. His inventions successfully linked theoretical approaches, experiments and practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biography&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born 1821 in Potsdam as Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand Helmholtz (the “von” came much later with his ennoblement), he was interested in the natural sciences ever since his early youth. As requested by his father and for financial reasons, he studied at the Berlin Military Academy and obtained his Doctor of Medicine at the age of 21. Over the years, he took several academic positions: associate professor of physiology at the Prussian University of Königsberg (1849, after being recommended by Alexander von Humboldt), professor of anatomy and physiology at the University of Bonn (1855), professor of physiology at the University of Heidelberg (1858) and finally, professor of physics at the University of Berlin (from 1871).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1887 the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (PTR) was founded in Charlottenburg as the first non-university research centre worldwide and Helmholtz was not only one of the founders but also the first president. The PTR was kind of a forerunner for the present-day Helmholtz Association (and by the way, it still exists as the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany’s national metrology institute). Helmholtz was married twice and had three sons and two daughters. 1894 he died in Charlottenburg and was buried in a “grave of honour” at a cemetery in Berlin-Wannsee.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research and Innovations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helmholtz made many outstanding contributions in a great range of scientific fields. As it would be impossible to mention them all in this blog entry, I focussed on several significant ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;physiology&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;psychology&lt;/strong&gt;, his research dealt with the mathematics of the eye and theories of vision, such as colour vision and the visual perception of space, as well as perception of sound and the sensation of tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His first contribution to &lt;strong&gt;physics&lt;/strong&gt; was a theoretical research on the conversation of energy for which he formulated a law. He also was the first scientist ever to measure the wavelengths of UV light and determine the capacity of a light microscope. His “three component theory of colour vision” which replaced the earlier six component model became especially relevant for colour television much later. In the field of &lt;strong&gt;acoustics&lt;/strong&gt;, he worked on the theory of air speed in open tubes and his research on &lt;strong&gt;hydrodynamics&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;electrodynamics&lt;/strong&gt; set new standards for the coming generations. A device still used nowadays is the &lt;strong&gt;Helmholtz coil&lt;/strong&gt;, which is able to produce a region of almost uniform magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;mathematics&lt;/strong&gt;, he made a major impact on modern meteorology as he studied thunderstorms, cyclones, water waves and air waves. The mathematical formulation of the first theorem of thermodynamics also goes back to Helmholtz. The partial differential &lt;strong&gt;Helmholtz equation&lt;/strong&gt; is often used in physical studies of problems in both space and time domain and was named for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the field of &lt;strong&gt;optics&lt;/strong&gt;, he invented the &lt;strong&gt;ophthalmoscope&lt;/strong&gt; (in German “Augenspiegel”), an instrument to visualize the retina of the eye for the first time ever, which made him suddenly world-famous. Another instrument developed by him is the &lt;strong&gt;ophtalmometer&lt;/strong&gt;, which is used to measure the curvature of the surface of the cornea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Helmholtz was also interested in &lt;strong&gt;philosophy&lt;/strong&gt;. In this field, he developed theories about the philosophy of science and the link between the laws of nature and perception.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that in mind, it is obvious why the six research fields of the Helmholtz Association cover the wide range of Energy, Earth and Environment, Health, Aeronautics, Space and Transport, Key Technologies and Matter. The Helmholtz Juniors come from all the different Helmholtz Centres and therefore represent this broad bandwidth. For a good sense of community and a successful teamwork in 2015, I hope very much that we will all feel “a bit more Helmholtz” and maybe this article helps a little bit on the way there&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

Since Open Access is such a great success, I want to give a short overview about history, different types to realize Open Access and the future development from Open Access to Open Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A brief look backwards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than ten years, the thought of open and free accessible research has been developed in the science landscape. A first big point was the “Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities”[1] in 2003, which was signed by the largest German research organizations like Helmholtz Association, Max Planck Society, Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft or Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFG and by international research organizations like Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) or Institut National del la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM). With this Berlin Declaration the major research organizations in Germany voted for Open Access in Science. Since then different declarations and guidelines for Open Access have been published. For example, the G8 Science Ministers declared at their meeting in June 2013 in London “We share the intention, therefore, to continue our cooperative efforts and will consider how best to address the global promotion of increasing public access to the results of publicly funded published research including to peer-reviewed published research and research data.”&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission made Open Access a general principle of EU’s Research &amp;amp; Innovation funding programme for 2014-2020, Horizon 2020. Thus, all articles produced with funding from Horizon 2020 will have to be available via one of the two recommended types of Open Access:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The golden way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The golden way of Open Access describes research publication in Open Access Journals. These Journals are accessible without any charge for the reader. Different Open Access publisher compensate the lack of subscription fees by different ways, such as funding organisations or article processing fees (the author’s institution pays for publishing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The green way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The green way describes the possibility of a so-called secondary publication. About 80 % of all journals of STM publisher (Scientific, Technical and Medical publisher) allow, with some restrictions, a publication of the accepted manuscript via an institutional repository, which makes the paper publicly available. This secondary publication must have the same content but do not need the same type setting. A typical restriction is a moratorium which has to be kept before publishing the paper a second time. Whether the secondary or primary publication is used for further research, you always have to cite the primary publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Germany, the Bundestag supports secondary publications with a change in “Urheberrechtsgesetz”. With the made change, a research paper can be secondary published after 12 months, whether the publisher agrees or not, if the following points are met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The research was funded publicly by at least 50 %&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The journal is published at least twice a year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The secondary publication will not serve a commercial purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of completeness, I should mention that traditional publisher try to keep up with Open Access and offer the possibility to make your paper publicly available within a subscription journal. But you have to be careful with this so called hybrid solution: You will have to pay higher article processing fees than in Open Access journals and your institution will pay nevertheless subscription fees to offer all other papers form this journal to you. Furthermore the green way is possible in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep Open Access in your mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making science available for a larger community via Open Access is an ongoing process. Open Access has a great support from different research organizations to political institutions up to the EU and G8. It is always worth to consider the possibility to publish the golden way or, at least, push the secondary publication via the green way. Within the Helmholtz Association the working group Open Science informs you about all possibilities of Open Access in general and provides contact information to all the working group members at your institute: &lt;a class="link" href="http://oa.helmholtz.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;http://oa.helmholtz.de/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A brief look forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open and free accessibility of research paper is on the move. However, research is not only done by writing a paper. It contains also collected data and written software to process the data. This is clarified by the term of Open Science. There are more and more efforts to make data accessible for example worldwide databases like the World Data System WDS[2] or the Data repository PANGEA[3]. Additionally, it is also possible to publish data as supplementary to a research paper and do this via a data repository of your institution.&lt;/p&gt;

New Helmholtz Juniors were introduced. We re-formed our working groups, elected new speakers and had interesting discussions and a nice time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday afternoon, the last year’s speakers Nicholas Engel and Sripriya Murthy welcomed the previous and new Helmholtz Juniors to the meeting. The speakers of last year’s working groups presented their work and achievements and suggested topics for 2015. The survey group has finished the first evaluation of the 2014 survey. The evaluation is currently discussed and will be released roughly within the next two months. Further groups are “communication”, “event”, “working conditions” and “steadification”. See our homepage (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.helmholtz.de/hejus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;www.helmholtz.de/hejus&lt;/a&gt;) for details on these groups. In the evening, the new Helmholtz Juniors chose their working groups. The groups of 2014 will be kept in 2015 and no new ones were established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second day started with a talk of Karin Lochte, head of the Alfred-Wegener-Institut, followed by a question and discussion session with her. After taking our group picture (the cover picture of the entry) we got a guided tour on the work of the AWI. Before lunch we met with Claudia Hanfland who coordinates the POLMAR graduate school (polmar.awi.de) and currently represents all Helmholtz graduate schools as their speaker. We discussed about the relevance of graduate schools and their function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, we had group working sessions in which the previous group’s speakers handed over their work to the new members. The first hours of group work were quite productive and we collected lots of new ideas and plans for 2015. Have a look on the picture of our group work sessions below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started on Friday with group working sessions and with electing group speakers. After that Xixi Feng presented PhDnet (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.phdnet.mpg.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;www.phdnet.mpg.de&lt;/a&gt;) which is the PhD candidate representation of the Max Planck Society. She is one of the speakers of PhDnet. There are some intersections in the topics on which HeJu and PhDnet work such as regular contracts instead of scholarships. Therefore we started sending speakers to each other’s annual meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last points on the agenda were the elections for the two HeJu speakers of 2015 and the decision on the location for the next year’s annual meeting. Daniel Neumann (Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht) and Meike Köhler (Helmholtz Zentrum München) were elected as speakers. The next year’s meeting will take place at the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) in Oberpfaffenhofen, close to Munich.&lt;/p&gt;

target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Helmholtz-Juniors&lt;/a&gt; (HeJu) in 2014 and take a look ahead to what’s to expect for 2015. Yuan (see authors) compiled our current &lt;a class="link" href="http://blogs.helmholtz.de/hejus/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2015/01/HeJu-Newsletter2014.pdf" title="HeJu-Newsletter 2014 (pdf)"

&gt;HeJu-Newsletter2014&lt;/a&gt; which gives you an overview about the work of 2014 and our contacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From January 22 to 24, 2014 the HeJus were kindly hosted by the Helmholtz Centre Dresden-Rossendorf (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=0" title="HZDR"

&gt;HZDR&lt;/a&gt;) in Dresden for their annual meeting. During that meeting the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/en/jobs_talents/doctoral_students/helmholtz_juniors/working_groups_activities/" title="working groups"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;working groups&lt;/a&gt; presented their achievements of the previous term, and new goals where set for the next HeJu, namely us (most members are only active for one year, a list of currently active members you can find &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/en/jobs_talents/doctoral_students/helmholtz_juniors/current_helmholtz_juniors/" title="HeJu members"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The most important goals being set the realization of the Helmholtz PhD survey 2014 (survey group), the active participation in the formulation of an updated version of the official Helmholtz &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/fileadmin/user_upload/06_jobs_talente/Doktoranden/Leitlinien_Doktorandenausbildung.pdf" title="PhD guidelines"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;doctoral training guidelines&lt;/a&gt; (working conditions group), the finalization of “the PhD booklet” (communication group) and coming up with a new concept for an interdisciplinary event for PhDs of the Helmholtz Association (HA) (events group). We also spoke with a Helmholtz official about financial support for our plans and the function and position of the HeJu within the HA. Additionally, we welcomed a representative of &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.phdnet.mpg.de" title="PhDnet"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;PhDnet&lt;/a&gt;, the PhD network of the Max Planck Society (MPG). Although being an official part of the MPG, they are known to be very critical towards their mother organization and fight for just working conditions and appropriate remuneration. They shared valuable information about their experience within the MPG and how they are organizing themselves. Vice versa Sripriya, one of our spokespersons last year, attended the annual meeting of PhDnet in Heidelberg later in 2014 and brought back interesting ideas for funding new events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also discussed current problems. For instance only 14 of the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/en/helmholtz_centres_networks/helmholtz_centres/" title="Helmholtz centres"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;18 Helmholtz centres&lt;/a&gt; were represented at the HeJu annual meeting, despite the centres agreeing to cover travel expenses for the meeting. Some representatives complained that the general will of students to engage for a representative function (meaning the DokTeams or PhD initiatives) at the individual centres was rather low among PhD students. It was also pointed out that there were difficulties in reaching all the PhD students working at one centre due to size, structural organization and the lack of networking possibilities. Other problems included the identification of the basic needs of PhD students of different subjects and at different centres (for instance: significantly lower salaries for PhDs in life science than for PhDs in engineering or similar subjects, not to mention PhDs in social science or the ones living on stipends).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From July 21 to 22 the HeJu met again at a mid-term meeting at the HA’s headquarters in Berlin thanks to the efforts of the events team who managed to get us comfortable in Berlin, and in touch with the headquarters for 2 days. This time 16 out of 18 centres were represented. A more detailed report about this event you can find &lt;a class="link" href="http://blogs.helmholtz.de/hejus/2014/09/helmholtz-juniors-mid-term-meeting-2014/" title="HeJu Mid-Term Meeting 2014"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This gave us the possibility to check up on the progress of single projects and to rethink others. Just before the meeting the survey group put their questionnaire online and was able to show first figures (I hope you all took part!). The fully analysed results will soon follow (see below). Also a new working group was formed: the embodiment group. Inspired by the organization of PhDnet, its members were to evaluate if becoming an official body of the HA (including a fixed annual budget) was worth giving up our current independence. The working conditions group was actually able to leave their critical mark on the new doctoral training guidelines (to be released this year) and the communication group was invited to take a look behind the HA public relation department in order to increase HeJu&amp;rsquo;s visibility at the Helmholtz centres and beyond. As a result, we have this blog online since September 2014 and we hope you enjoy reading it. We will use it to keep you all updated about our work and also hope to get some discussions going about PhD life (or &lt;a class="link" href="http://blogs.helmholtz.de/hejus/2014/11/life-after-phd/" title="Life after PhD"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;after life&lt;/a&gt;) in general. Feel free to leave your comments and ideas and have a look on our &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/en/working_at_helmholtz/doctoral_students/helmholtz_juniors/" title="Helmholtz-Juniors"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and our new &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/helmholtz.juniors" title="HeJu Facebook"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;facebook page&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what’s to come in 2015? Big milestone ahead of course: the annual HeJu meeting at the Alfred Wegener Institute (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.awi.de" title="AWI"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;AWI&lt;/a&gt;) in Bremerhaven this week from January 14 to 16! There we will see how happy YOU are and at which centre you are happiest according to the results of the Helmholtz PhD survey. Information, each individual centre is also very interested in. We will present an online version of the PhD booklet (due to difficulties with the layout, a print version will only be available at a later time point but, we wanted to make sure that you can access this information asap). We hope that many of new and old PhD students in Germany will find it very useful. We will discuss our impact on the new Helmholtz doctoral training guidelines and the pros and cons of an official embodiment within the HA. We will see what concept the event group came up with and if we will again get support for an additional mid-term meeting. One of the more difficult topics is the question if PhD students should get stipends or contracts. There is a will of the HA to provide each PhD student with a contract rather than a stipend but, this is, of course, not yet reality. Given the tight financial situation for personnel money in science in general and at certain centres in particular, this will still be an issue in the future. An issue that probably has to be discussed with Otmar Wiestler, now head of the German Cancer Research Centre (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.dkfz.de" title="DKFZ"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;DKFZ&lt;/a&gt;), who will replace Jürgen Mlynek after 10 years as HA&amp;rsquo;s new president in September this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very important point will be the handing over of our work to the ones of you that will take over our tasks. Due to the short HeJu terms, a thorough transfer of information is crucial for an efficient continuation. Thus, let’s look forward to what the next HeJu generation will have in store for us. I will surely keep checking up on the news here. Good luck! :)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Summer Schools</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2014/11/summer-schools/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2014/11/summer-schools/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2014/11/summer-schools/images/Peyresq.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Summer Schools" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know this feeling? You go to your office every day, you work in your own little world, mostly on your own and at some point you start thinking: why do I do this? Who will profit from my work when it&amp;rsquo;s finished (&lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; one day it will actually be finished)? Who will even read it? Will it really make the world a little bit better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it happens to me every now and then. It&amp;rsquo;s not fun. Motivation drops, I can&amp;rsquo;t concentrate, I want to leave work immediately and do something really important that will save the world. In good moments I have thousands of ideas about what would be more useful than what I do now. In bad moments I&amp;rsquo;m completely lost and can&amp;rsquo;t think of anything that could possibly have a positive effect on anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more or less the mood I was in when I left for the Alter-Net Summer School in Peyresq, Haute-de-Provence, France in September this year. And then, something wonderful happened: I spent 10 days with 30 other students and almost as many lecturers and tutors in a beautiful, picturesque little village in the Provence mountains, talking, discussing and listening to lectures about &amp;ldquo;Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services&amp;rdquo;. And these 10 days not only changed my so to speak professional point of view of the whole topic (with which my PhD topic is also related) but it also made me even more emotionally connected to it. The lectures and discussions were at times frightening or worrying, at times optimistic and always motivating and inspiring. I felt that with so many bright people (some already with lots of experience, some having just started) working on this huge problem of global habitat and biodiversity loss together we could actually make a change. I now feel connected and part of a bigger picture. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel alone with my work any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lectures covered a wide variety of topics all connected to biodiversity and ecosystem services, giving us a broad picture. We got to know &amp;ldquo;A business perspective on biodiversity&amp;rdquo; (Timo Lehesvirta), talked about &amp;ldquo;The challenges of communicating science&amp;rdquo; in the media (Mary Colwell-Hector), learned about &amp;ldquo;Landscape variability and impacts of ammonia in relation to the Habitat Directive&amp;rdquo; (Mark Sutton) and discussed &amp;ldquo;A critical perspective on valuation&amp;rdquo; of ecosystem services (Erik Gomez). And this is just giving a few examples of the many lectures and discussions we had. We also worked on a mock EU-project on how to evaluate and sustainably manage the services provided by the ecosystems in the Verdon catchment area (which is the area where the little village we stayed in is located).&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But apart from all the (very interesting) scientific content, what was most important and inspiring for me was to get in touch with people from all over the world, working on the same pressing problem in different fields and from different perspectives. I made great friends! By living together, eating together, drinking and dancing together at night, going for some hikes and walks in the area, watching the amazing stars in the  night, through every morning&amp;rsquo;s yoga classes and a day-long excursion to see all the beautiful places in the area (Le Lac du Sainte Croix, the canyon, vultures, lavender fields, an organic goat farm), we really got to know each other quite well and we are already thinking about where and when to meet again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Summer Schools really give you the opportunity to view your topic from a wider perspective, to get new idea and to get in touch with people who work in the same research field. What&amp;rsquo;s more, most of the speakers included in their talks some reports about the &amp;ldquo;real working world&amp;rdquo; and their experiences. They were also very happy to share their experiences of and views on the work life in individual chats and to answer all the questions we had. So I think some of us ended up with a clearer idea of what we want to do after our PhDs, what we can expect when we start working and what is expected from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I can only recommend to any PhD student to find out about opportunities to take part in a Summer or Winter school. maybe your research centre itself offers one. Or they give funding for their students to take part in these Summer Schools hosted by other institutions. Especially when you&amp;rsquo;re stuck with your work, getting out there, meeting other people and thinking outside your little office might really help! It did for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Life after PhD</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2014/11/life-after-phd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2014/11/life-after-phd/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When using internet search engines on the phrase “Life after PhD” you find (besides the oh so well-known and loved PhD comics by Jorge Cham) many blogs and personal webpages all dealing with life after PhD – but mostly focusing on the world outside of academia. You find pages like “&lt;a class="link" href="http://fromphdtolife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;From PhD to Life&lt;/a&gt;”, “&lt;a class="link" href="http://lifeafterthephd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&gt;11 alternative careers for PhD students&lt;/a&gt;” , and so on and so forth. Several hits below, there is finally one link dealing with career advices if you want to stay in academia (&lt;a class="link" href="http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2014_07_01/caredit.a1400168" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). How come? What makes many of us first choose a long and laborious education to then finally switch to something completely different?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us think back to the time when we decided to go to University to study our dream profession. We were highly enthusiastic, our curiosity reaching from the deepest oceans out to space and our motivation was nothing less than learning how to cure world’s most threatening diseases or finding a solution to climate change induced environmental problems. Well, maybe a bit over the top, but I guess we all had our plans and dreams at the begin of our university education. And for many of us it was the idea of being an independent investigator and doing discovery- or hypothesis-driven research that attracted us towards doing a dissertation. And then, at some point sooner or later, we discover that an academic career is no ‘walk in the park’ at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey among Helmholtz PhD Students in 2009/2010 showed that only 9% want to go for a post doc position in Germany, the majority wants to switch to industry or go abroad (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/jobundberuf/junge-forscher-max-planck-doktoranden-wollen-stipendien-abschaffen-a-829548.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;). One of the main reasons is low salaries and the high amount of temporary contracts, which make life planning very difficult. In Germany 90% of the scientific staff has only a temporary contract; the majority of these contracts have a runtime of less than one year (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.academics.de/wissenschaft/perspektiven_fuer_postdocs_52464.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;). A recent OECD study showed that five years after receiving their degrees, more than 60% of PhDs in Slovakia and more than 45% in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany and Spain were still on temporary contracts. Many of them were postdocs (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.economist.com/node/17723223?story_id=17723223" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;). In England, France or the United States on the other hand scientific careers besides the classical professorship are still customary. But looking closer at articles and blogs from US or British post docs, they as well report a worsening of working conditions. The most common points of critique are low salary, long working hours, little recognition and fierce competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite this questionable situation, today we have more PhDs worldwide than ever before. Between 1998 and 2006 the number of doctorates handed out in all OECD countries grew by 40% (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.economist.com/node/17723223?story_id=17723223" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;). The German statistical office reports that more than 200 000 dissertations were supervised in Germany during winter semester 2010/2011 (&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.destatis.de/DE/Publikationen/Thematisch/BildungForschungKultur/Hochschulen/Promovierende.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;). So obviously still many young people, more than ever before, initially accept suboptimal conditions because they want to do their dream job. But even if you accept harsh working conditions and low payment, the competition for academic positions is severe. For every available opening for a tenure-track professorship in the United States, there are roughly seven postdocs (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.economist.com/node/17723223?story_id=17723223" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;), and the situation in other countries might not be brighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devastated after reading all that? Don’t be. If you managed to do your PhD in Germany, maybe within the Helmholtz Association or in any other research institute or University, you are privileged! You own the privilege of belonging to the group of people that could choose and afford the education they love. And even if you should decide to leave academia - you are well educated and prepared for all the adventures and challenges that wait for you out there. And if you decide to stay in academia, the Helmholtz Association and other institutions in Germany offer funding to make the start easier. And most of these research fellowships are accessible for international students, too! Find below some info about the funding for early career scientists provided by the Helmholtz association and links to other institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let me end here with the famous advice from Douglas Adams (valid not only for PhD students ;-) Don’t Panic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I read a book on guide to scientific writing which I felt can be very useful to all early researchers. This blog is distillation of what I learnt. I came across a nice phrase which says &amp;quot; publish or perish &amp;ldquo;.  The phrase nicely sums up the academic life of a researcher who is inevitably judged by the number and quality of his/her published paper.   Before you start writing a scientific paper, there are few basic questions that you need to know.  The questions are as following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why to publish?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main motive behind publishing a scientific paper is to communicate your research, to make your work visible to the world. You may also want to publish your research as part of your quest for fame, fortune or for tenure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What to publish?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard and fast rule on the content of a publication is research should be absolutely reproducible. People following your research should have same results under the limit of statistical acceptable fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who should publish?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the research comprises of a team including senior scientists, post-doctoral fellows, graduate students or technicians. The most senior member in the team owns the privilege of approving manuscripts and submits it to a journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to publish?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scientific research is always a follow up or extension of some previous published work. Therefore, you should know your target journal before you start writing. However, if your work is of broader interest then you might try to publish in &lt;em&gt;Science, Nature,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;or the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America&lt;/em&gt; (known as &lt;em&gt;“PNAS”&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the skills required for research are also required for writing a scientific paper, for example, planning, organization and attentiveness, but for sure writing a paper also requires many additional skills.  The difference in magnitude amplifies if your native language is not same in which you want to write paper. However, there are some common mistakes that scientists make when they write up their research for publication and if you take care of those mistakes then you can make life easier to some extent. Here, I tried to sum up all those common mistakes and how can they be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never ignore the instructions of the target journal to Authors. Every journal that is published supplies specific Instructions to Authors, follow them religiously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The language of manuscript (mostly English) should be grammatically correct and absolutely free of ambiguity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain spelling consistency. For instance if you are targeting American journal then you should use American spelling of all words. If you are submitting your paper to British, Canadian, or European journal, you should use British spelling consistently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be careful with the use of &lt;em&gt;“that”&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;“which”&lt;/em&gt;. Compare the following sentences, “The cells grew in the enriched medium that contained calcium ions” and “The cells grew in the enriched medium, which contained calcium ions. “ The first sentence emphasizes on the “calcium medium” making it distinct from the other mediums. The second sentence emphasizes on that cells were able to grow in the enriched medium, sentence at the same time includes some additional information about the content of medium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“None” in a sentence means “not one” and it is singular.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abbreviations need to be written out in full form when they are mentioned first time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is common practice to write numbers from one to ten as words (for example, write “one” for “1”) unless abbreviated units follow the number. For example, you should not write “three g/l”. The correct version is “3 g/l”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use semi colons to separate items in complicated big sentences. For example, if you are making cake, you need the following ingredients: butter, preferably unsalted but salted can be used if unsalted not available; sugar either granulated or powdered; eggs, which should be fresh. As you can see, semicolons allow each description of ingredients to be separated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be careful with the use of a participle (an &lt;em&gt;“-ing”&lt;/em&gt; word, such as standing, running, and jumping). A participle should always relate to subject in the sentence. For example, use of incorrect related participle results in one such sentence, “The cells were grown in ABC medium containing glycine”. Here, subject in the sentence which is “The cells” doesn’t directly relate to glycine, therefore correct version will be “The cells were grown in ABC medium, which contained glycine”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid using nouns as adjectives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“This”&lt;/em&gt; is often incorrect. For example, after a lengthy description of his results, a author might start a new sentence with “This showed ….. “ without specifically mentioning the observation. Therefore, it is necessary to start the sentence by referring to specific observation, for example, “The formation of cell clumps showed ….. “.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phrase “due to” can link only two nouns. It cannot be used as adverb. For example, it will be incorrect to say, “Due to the presence of an enzyme, we saw blue colonies”. The correct version will be , “The formation of blue colonies was due to presence of an enzyme in the cells.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid using many fonts on the title page, choose simple and plain font, such as Helvetica, and use it for every item on your title page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always use &amp;ldquo;briefly&amp;rdquo; instead of  phrase &amp;ldquo;in brief&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid inconsistent formatting in the body parts, for example, should the title have one capital M or two (&amp;rdquo; Material and Methods &amp;quot; or &amp;quot; Material and methods &amp;quot; )?, should the title be left or on the center aligned? etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay attention to the punctuations in your reference list. Depending on the journal the range of punctuation combinations varies, for example, two authors can be listed simply as &amp;ldquo;Andrews AK and Mohr L&amp;rdquo; or as  &amp;ldquo;Andrews, A.K., and Mohr, L.&amp;rdquo; and in some journals, an ampersand &amp;ldquo;&amp;amp;&amp;rdquo; replaces &amp;ldquo;and&amp;rdquo; to yield &amp;ldquo;Andrews, A.K., &amp;amp; Mohr L.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphs and histograms should always indicate standard deviations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results should be related to the title of your paper and should be absolutely reproducible. Pay attention to organization of results, some journals encourage condensation of Results and Discussion into one section. The commonest mistake researchers make in the presentation of numerical data involving the number of significant figures and decimal places. Try limiting the number of digits after decimal to make number meaningful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this blog helps a bit to all my peers, Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Bringing Science to the General Public</title><link>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2014/10/bringing-science-to-the-general-public/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2014/10/bringing-science-to-the-general-public/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2014/10/bringing-science-to-the-general-public/images/1424446_783747001689916_7744879657812596835_n.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Bringing Science to the General Public" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, we had the &amp;ldquo;Tag der Forschung&amp;rdquo; - our open day - at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht (HZG). It took place on a sunny Saturday even though rain was forecasted. Laboratories and other facilities were open to the public, there was a stage with live music and children could dress up as *real* scientists, participate in a research quiz and build particle detectors with Lego. I also built one (see picture 1). Also, some parents built their own ones. In one case the parents even wanted to stay longer than their child. All particle detectors can be found here: &lt;a class="link" href="http://bit.ly/LEGO-HZG" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p&gt;Why should we - researchers or future researchers - care about showing people what we are doing? An open day costs a lot of money and time which could have been invested in research instead. However, it brings research closer to people who do not have a connection to research in their everyday life. It shows for what purpose tax money is spent. It may motivate pupils to start studying subjects related to our work with the aim to go into research later. It offers people the opportunity to enter areas which are commonly restricted to research personal only. People have a nice day at our working place. It shows that researchers normally look quite normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wondering what other Helmholtz Zentren do with respect to presenting their research to the public. They do quite a lot. Every second Helmholtz Zentrum had a open day within the last three years. At least HZB (Berlin), UFZ (Leipzig), GFZ (Potsdam), Desy (Hamburg) and HZG (Geesthacht/Hamburg) were active at &amp;ldquo;Nights of Knowledge&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Nights of Research&amp;rdquo;. Desy and DLR have their own magazines. Several Helmholtz Zentren or individuals working there have blogs on which they regularly post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also two upcoming events. Perhaps you are close by and have time to take a look?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Day at the DLR (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt) in Oberpfaffenhofen, 12th October 2014: &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.dlr.de/dlr/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10291/846_read-402/date-1251/#/gallery/13123" title="Open Day DLR"

&lt;p&gt;What do I want to express with this blog entry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The open day at HZG was a nice day and I got to know some colleagues which I did not know before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open days, nights of knowledge and other similar events are important for representing our institutes and for transferring some basic knowledge to visitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a look what people at other researchers do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a nice weekend :-) .&lt;/li&gt;

target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Helmholtz-Juniors&lt;/a&gt; (or more informally “HeJu”) got together for their mid-term meeting at the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/en/about_us/" title="Helmholtz Association"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Helmholtz Association&lt;/a&gt;’s head office in Berlin. It was the second time we met this year after our first meeting at the Helmholtz Center Dresden-Rossendorf (&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=139" title="HZDR"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;HZDR&lt;/a&gt;) in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is useful to mention here that the HeJu’s are not an official body of the Helmholtz Association, but a diverse group of volunteering PhD students who are committed to improve PhD working conditions and connect PhDs within the Helmholtz Association as well as within Germany (look at this &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/en/helmholtz_centres_networks/helmholtz_centres/" title="Helmholtz Centers"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; to see where we are located). This includes a cacophony of emails, phone calls, doodle lists, literature research and skype conferences. And all that we are trying to manage on the side to our own demanding PhD projects, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I was really looking forward to the meeting as we had set ambitious goals back in January and our predecessors had informed us that it might be difficult to keep up the motivation for our projects throughout the entire year. Thus, we decided to get together again already after half a year to renew our HeJu energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there we were: One and a half days full of reports, heated discussions, brainstorming and coffee overflow. First of all our spokespersons Nicholas and Sripriya and our four &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/en/jobs_talents/doctoral_students/helmholtz_juniors/working_groups_activities/" title="Working Groups"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;working groups&lt;/a&gt; presented the progress so far. The main achievements have been the active participation in an update of the Helmholtz Association’s official PhD guidelines (which virtually has some effect on all Helmholtz PhD students), the finishing of our “Helmholtz PhD booklet” (we will keep you posted about this!) and the launch of this year’s &lt;a class="link" href="http://heju-survey.de" title="HeJu Survey"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;PhD survey&lt;/a&gt; (where every PhD student under Helmholtz can actually help to improve the conditions, hopefully you all took part. But, don’t worry if not, it’s still possible until Sep 19th!!! Go for it!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2014/09/helmholtz-juniors-mid-term-meeting-2014/images/events-300x199.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to our “events” group who was busy organizing this meeting we’ve been in close contact with officials of the Helmholtz Association and the direct feedback was helping a lot to shape common goals and to identify certain (im)possibilities. For instance, what financial support can we expect and what are the advantages and disadvantages of becoming an official body of the Helmholtz Association? A topic so fundamental, that the formation of a new working group was required to evaluate its pros and cons. But, a special treat for us was the visit of Prof. Dr. Jürgen Mlynek, &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.helmholtz.de/en/about_us/president/" title="HA president"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;president&lt;/a&gt; of the Helmholtz Association, who took some time to welcome us personally in the headquarter and also stayed for a quick Q&amp;amp;A session (see header). How much closer can you get as a PhD student to the very head of your research organization?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.helmholtz-juniors.de/p/2014/09/helmholtz-juniors-mid-term-meeting-2014/images/EmbodimentGroup-300x199.jpg"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During several sessions the individual working groups discussed and developed new ideas and eventually set the goals for the rest of the term. Furthermore, we were lucky to talk with the public relations officials, who gave us vital support on our visibility and communication structure as well as an insight into their day-to-day work. A result of which we have this brand new Blog you happened to be reading right now and the new &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.facebook.com/helmholtz.juniors?fref=ts" title="HeJu FB"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;HeJu’s logo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is left to do for this year? Of course, the discussion on the PhD guidelines is not over yet and will go on. One goal, for example, is to increase contract positions for PhDs in relation to scholarships. The “survey” group will have a busy time analyzing the survey results and wrapping that up until January next year, when the HeJu’s meet again at the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.awi.de/en/home/" title="AWI"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Alfred Wegener Institute&lt;/a&gt; in Bremerhaven. The PhD booklet will be published and available for everyone who’s interested (some interviews with the people involved will be up as well). We are also planning a special event where PhD students can connect and get information on career options and this Blog will be filled with more articles about our work as HeJu’s and topics about PhD life in general. Feel free to comment and ask questions below.&lt;/p&gt;
