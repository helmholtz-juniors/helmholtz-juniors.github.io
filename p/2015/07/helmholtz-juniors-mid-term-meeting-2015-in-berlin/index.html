She gave a brief overview of the history of the German “Großforschungseinrichtungen” and of the the Helmholtz Association and described the process from narrow research topics towards nowadays program oriented research and the program oriented funding (“Programmorientierte Förderung”, POF). The interesting talk and the following discussion gave us the opportunity to gain a better understanding of mechanisms and politics in science and education in general and in the Helmholtz Association, in particular.</p><p>The last part of the first day was dedicated to a discussion on an overall strategy of the Helmholtz Juniors and on tasks for upcoming half year and their priority:</p><ul><li>focus for the working conditions group: reduce number of in-house stipends and increase number of vacation days to 28 or 30</li><li>improve the motivation of all PhD students to be part in the local PhD representative initiatives and in the Helmholtz Juniors.</li><li>enhance visibility of the Helmholtz Juniors: Only if we are visible, we can change something.</li><li>strengthen the connection to the HGF head office</li><li>strengthen our network to other groups which work for improving working conditions in science</li><li>improve continuity after handover to new Helmholtz Juniors</li></ul><p>The first day was concluded with dinner in a nice restaurant in Berlin‘s center.</p><p><img src=/p/2015/07/helmholtz-juniors-mid-term-meeting-2015-in-berlin/images/DSCF4515_med-300x200.jpg width=300 height=200 srcset="/p/2015/07/helmholtz-juniors-mid-term-meeting-2015-in-berlin/images/DSCF4515_med-300x200_hu_c1c8fb1f4d714433.jpg 480w, /p/2015/07/helmholtz-juniors-mid-term-meeting-2015-in-berlin/images/DSCF4515_med-300x200_hu_8ce64420117126d4.jpg 1024w" loading=lazy alt="Discussing the Helmholtz Junior’s future plans" class=gallery-image data-flex-grow=150 data-flex-basis=360px></p><p>The second day of our Mid-term meeting was dedicated towards group work. The working conditions group recapitulated their meeting with Elsbeth Lesner from the previous day. The Event group started planning a Helmholtz PhD day which should take place in 2016. Both, the Survey and the Communications working groups attended an Q&amp;A session with Jan-Martin Wiarda, Bianca Berlin and Janine Tychsen from the Helmholtz Communications and Media Relations Office. The three of them were faced with several questions on internal and external communication issues. Besides receiving useful answers, possible contacts for our communication-related issues, and insight into the current projects of their group, we were encouraged to raise a critical voice inside and outside of the Helmholtz Association whenever necessary.</p><p>With a wrap-up and a basket of tasks for the upcoming months, we finished our Mid-term meeting in the early afternoon.</p><p>At this point we, the Helmholtz Juniors, want to thank all our guests, the Helmholtz Association&rsquo;s Head Office and the events working group. The meeting was a great success and will motivate us and enhance our future work.</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/berlin/>Berlin</a>
