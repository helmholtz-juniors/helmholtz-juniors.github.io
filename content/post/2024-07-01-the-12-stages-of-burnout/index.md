We as Doctoral Researchers (DRs) work in a highly competitive environment. In contrast to other professions, our tasks are not clearly defined. Instead, we have the liberty and the responsibility to balance a diverse range of activities such as practical lab work, data analysis, reading papers, writing papers, extracurricular activities, and much more.

From time to time, this multitude of tasks can get overwhelming; most of us have experienced this first-hand. However, if this state of high stress prevails over extended durations with no recovery periods, we run the risk of experiencing "**burnout**".

To put the term into context, we use the definition by psychologists H. Freudenberger and G. North, who introduced a first framework delineating the twelve stages of burnout in their book from 1992. Each of these stages is characterized by a set of symptoms that individuals may exhibit at the respective progression level. That being said, it is important to acknowledge that experiences and symptom severity may vary from individual to individual. The progression of burnout can manifest subtly and escape immediate recognition.

Nonetheless, the stages outlined below can provide orientation for assessing one’s risk of burning out:

1. **Excessive Ambition:** Individuals often start with enthusiasm and high ambition. They have high expectations of themselves, aiming to achieve more than they realistically can.
2. **Increased Commitment:** As the pressure to achieve these high-set goals intensifies, individuals push themselves to work harder and take on new tasks, often exceeding their physical and mental limits.
3. **Neglecting Own Needs:** In pursuit of their objectives, individuals tend to overlook their own well-being, neglecting essential self-care practices such as adequate sleep, proper nutrition, and relaxation.
4. **Displacing (Private) Problems:** Rather than addressing personal issues or stressors, individuals channel their focus and energy into work, using it to avoid confronting underlying problems.
5. **Revision of Values:** The continuous stress and strain lead to a reassessment of personal priorities, where work takes precedence over other crucial aspects of life such as health, relationships, and hobbies. Emotional blunting and attention deficits may occur.
6. **Denial of New Problems:** Even as new stressors arise, individuals may deny their significance or the toll that they take, attempting to persevere despite the mounting burdens.
7. **Withdrawal from Relationships:** Feeling overwhelmed and emotionally drained, individuals start to withdraw from social interactions, isolating themselves and reducing communication with friends, family, and colleagues.
8. **Impact on Others:** The growing burnout begins to affect not only the individual but also their relationships and interactions with others, causing strain and often altering the dynamics of their personal and professional connections.
9. **Depersonalization:** To distance themselves from the stress and emotional cost, individuals may start perceiving themselves and others in a detached, impersonal manner, losing the sense of connection and empathy.
10. **Inner Emptiness:** Over time, the persistent burnout leads to a profound sense of emptiness, where the individual struggles to find fulfillment or purpose in their work and/or life.
11. **Depression:** The deepening emotional exhaustion and disillusionment can progress into a state of depression, characterized by constant feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities. An intense desire for extended sleep or even suicidal thoughts may develop.
12. **Full Burnout Syndrome:** Finally, after enduring the various stages of burnout, individuals may reach a point of full burnout, experiencing a complete depletion of physical, emotional, and mental resources. This often requires significant intervention and support to recover from.

If you feel like you have already progressed to some of the aforementioned stages, please take a step back. If you realize that one of your colleagues is increasingly displaying visible signs of burnout such as social withdrawal, it would be good to approach them and ask about their current situation. After recognizing burnout, seeking help and practicing self-care are crucial steps for recovery and for maintaining stable mental health.

It is important to realize that burnout is not a sign of weakness, but rather a **natural response** to overwhelming stress. Talk about your feelings and what you are experiencing with friends and family and/or seek professional help. Do more of what makes you happy and gives you energy. Say “no” more and draw clear boundaries – it may be difficult, but it is an important measure to prevent burnout. You are strong, and you WILL get through this! With time and support, you can find balance and happiness in your life again. And lastly, never forget:

**you are not alone**. :)
