This time the GFZ (German Research Centre for Geosciences) answers our 5 Questions.

**German Research Centre for Geosciences, by PR department (Send to us by Bernhard)**

 

1) How would you describe your institute?

The GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences is the national research centre for Earth sciences. Our research focuses on the geosphere within the highly complex System Earth with its further subsystems, its interacting subcycles, and its wide network of cause-and-effect chains. This we do in a close interdisciplinary collaboration with the related scientific disciplines physics, mathematics, chemistry, and biology as well as with the engineering sciences disciplines of rock mechanics, engineering hydrology and seismology.

 

2) What are the most interesting results or topics of your work/institute (in the last 3-5 years)?

It’s hard to say as there is plenty of extremly interesting stuff ranging from identifying tiny ancient fragments of a „lost continent“ called Mauritia to the GRACE mission which has tripled its lifetime and yielded extremely valuable data on Earth's gravity field.

 

3) What makes your institute special among others in the same field?

Several things make us special. First, we combine many disciplines from chemistry, biology, physiks to mathematics and of course all sorts of geosciences. Then, secondly, we are large and run many observatories world-wide, eg. our GEOFON network or our geo-magnetic observatories. Third, we are extremely well connected in the Berlin-Brandenburg region as well as in Europe and overseas.

4) What characteristics should a doctoral researcher have to become a successful scientist in your field and/or in general?

Stamina, curiosity, and quite a stable stomach as the food on field trips is sometimes rather special.

5) What is your special advice for doctoral researchers and young scientists?

Do it, and talk about it.
